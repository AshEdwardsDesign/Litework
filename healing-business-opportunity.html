                    <p>Our low level laser emits a visible coherent light that is applied to the affected area. Bundles of light energy pass through the layers of the skin and are received within the cell membrane by specific receptors. This causes an increase
                        in energy within the cell which jump-starts changes that positively affect several biological processes. This in turn initiates increased blood circulation to the area and enhances tissue regeneration. The overall effects are decreased
                        pain and inflammation, and increased range of motion.</p>
                    <p>Low Level Laser Therapy, uses low power or ‘soft’ laser light to alter cellular function, speeding up your body’s natural healing process safely and effectively.</p>
                    <p>Put simply, by directly treating damaged tissue with particular and appropriate wavelengths of light, your body’s healing cells are stimulated and recovery is optimised.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why use this particular Low Level Laser?</strong></p>
                    <p>Low level lasers are known as “cold” lasers as they do not have a thermal effect and are used to stimulate rather than destroy tissue. These low level lasers have been in use for over 25 years and there are no side effects.</p>
                    <p>Laser therapy is a non-invasive procedure, meaning that it does not require a surgical incision. This means that there is no prolonged recovery time. Laser therapy also does not involve taking any medications (many patients prefer
                        to avoid taking medications).</p>
                    <p>Studies have been done on low level lasers and have been proven to be effective in many cases, but it was this laser that made history by becoming the first low-level laser in the world to gain market clearance for the treatment of
                        chronic neck and shoulder pain.</p>
                    <p>This was proven through studies to prove the effectiveness of this laser on chronic pain. Please feel free to ask for Light Healing Clinic’s application and overview.</p>
                    <p><strong>Are there any side effects?</strong></p>
                    <p>The “cold” laser does not cause any tissue damage as a healthy cell will exhibit weak or no effects from the low-power laser while unhealthy cells will exhibit strong effects. The photons of the laser are strong enough to alter the
                        shape of certain receptor proteins in the mitochondrial cell membrane, but weak enough not to damage crucial molecules such as DNA, enzymes (proteins), and lipids.</p>
                    <p><strong>How long does it take?</strong></p>
                    <p>Our low level laser has multiple laser beams which are programmable to multiple frequencies. There is a different protocol for each condition or complaint with 4 different frequencies used and the treatment time can take anywhere from
                        90 seconds to 3 minutes. Acute problems can be treated every day for a few days while chronic complaints are usually best handled with 3-4 treatments per week.</p>
                    <p><strong>Does it hurt?</strong></p>
                    <p>No. People are receptive to light healing to varying degrees – some can feel the laser right down to their toes and others are entirely unaware of any sensation. Those that feel it mention slight warmth to the area being treated or
                        a minimal tingling sensation.</p>
                    <p><strong>What are the clinical effects and benefits of light healing?</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Other benefits of our Low Level Laser</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduction of the formation of scar tissue</li>

                    <p><strong>Laser Acupuncture provides:</strong></p>
                    <p>Laser Acupuncture involves low level laser beams being used to stimulate acupuncture points. Laser is used both as a non-needle alternative and as a medium in its own right with its own distinct energising characteristics, extending
                        the range of acupuncture treatment options available.</p>
                    <p>Laser is a particularly useful modality for needle-phobic clients and children, being aseptic, painless and having relatively short treatment times.</p>
                    <p><strong>Smoking Cessation</strong></p>
                    <p>Low Level Lasers for smoking cessation have been in use since the 1970’s in the UK and Canada and has recently seen an explosion of clinics in the US, South America, Australia, South Africa, Middle and Far East.</p>
                    <p>Treatment traditionally employs use of non-invasive, non-thermal laser to stimulate acupuncture points, total treatment time is around 15 minutes for a maximum of 4 treatments over 14 days.</p>
                    <p>The clients experience a reduction in withdrawal symptoms and while counselling is encouraged as part of the clinical procedure and for best results, research has still shown significant results in double-blind studies with application
                        of the laser alone. There is no lingering nicotine addiction and no side effects.</p>

                    <p>Extremely versatile, the unit accepts the complete range of interchangeable probes, allowing treatment of everything from deeper muscular penetration and acupuncture point stimulation. The flexibility to enter repeatable treatment
                        times in 5 second increments is offered via an intuitive menu system and the unit then automatically calculates the resultant energy density ‘dose’ to be delivered.</p>
                    <p>The unit offers a range of pulsing frequency options and the ability to set three different pulsing repetition rates within one treatment through the multi-pulse facility. This affords the practitioner pulse variation capability without
                        having to reset. This control unit has a built-in beam tester which gives an accurate reading of the single probe outputs, meaning that the user can always check that the equipment is working properly – so important when invisible
                        wavelengths are in use.</p>
                    <p>The unit also includes an acupuncture point finder, which gives a continuous electronic reading indicating the proximity of acupuncture points. The micro-current conductivity measurement which is used to identify such points can also
                        locate trigger points making it an indispensable tool for physical therapists. This feature utilises a purpose-designed hand probe and acupuncture probe tip, both of which are included in the package.</p>
                    <p>This unit is designed so that it can be used in the carry case, and placing the bag’s strap over the shoulder or around the waist can leave the clinician’s hands free for treatment. When used in a clinic the separate stand (which can
                        be purchased seperately) positions the unit with complete stability and visibility on any flat surface.</p>

            <p>On average most people will need 4-8 sessions in the desired area, although a lot of people will require ongoing treatments, this makes the model great for repeat, on-going business.</p>
            <p>Light healing clinic recommends 4 sessions per week, over a 4 week period. So at £30 (recommended) per 15 minute session, 1 hour per week will generate you £120 from each customer. This is amazingly cost effective when you compare it to the
                £50 or more per treatment that private clinics will charge. Plus, you’re going to them, which in a lot of cases is a great bonus as some people who have bad injuries (for example, the elderly) may not be able to get out to clinics or will
                just point blank refuse to go.</p>
            <p>Treating just 4 customers per week, which equates to only 4 hours work, can make you nearly £500.00 per week! That’s only 4 customers to earn nearly £2,000.00 per month for 4 hours work! Imagine how much you can earn once you’re established
                with regular customers and, with our help and unique referral system this could be just weeks away!</p>
