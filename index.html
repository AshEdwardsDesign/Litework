                        <p>Hi everyone, I'm Rachel – owner and founder of Inch Go Lipo. I have personally undergone surgical liposuction and I know first hand what it is like to struggle with self confidence and body issues. I invested in Inch Go Lipo as
                            I'm passionate about getting the message out to men and women, that surgical liposuction is not always the answer. Also exercise and diet cannot always move those last stubborn inches. Just imagine – no needles, no pain, no
                            six months downtime to recover and NO exorbitant fees. Who knew?</p>
                        <p>Well, modern technology has evolved so much that you can now have liposuction and cryolipolysis on the high street in your lunch hour and go straight back to work.</p>
                        <p>I empathise and understand and relate to you ALL which is why I want to get the message around that it actually works. So, if YOU or someone you know (male or female) would like my help, then I cannot wait to meet you and start
                            your journey from a crysalis to a beautiful butterfly.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-white"><strong>What we do</strong></h3>

                        <p><strong>Fact! Over 90% of women, all shapes, sizes and ages, suffer from cellulite. Cellulite is the name given to lumpy, irregular fatty deposits.
                                Cellulite begins to form during puberty, but it’s not always noticeable on younger women because their skin is more supple. Cellulite also affects men as well. Cavitation is a great procedure for those “hard to target” areas like the stomach, thighs, hips, arms, buttocks and even love handles.</strong></p>

                        <h4 class="text-white"><strong>What is cavitation?<strong></h4>

                        <p>Cavitation lipo is a non-surgical liposuction treatment. The treatment requires no anaesthetic, leaves no scars, has no discomfort, and no disruption to your daily activities or routine; it presents a risk-free alternative to expensive
                            liposuction.</p>

                        <p><strong>“The result is loss of fat”</strong></p>

                        <p>Most of us have some stubborn fat deposits that never seem to disappear no matter what your diet or how hard you work out. Cavitation is a natural phenomenon based on low frequency ultrasound. The energy in the form of heat (minor
                            effect) and pressure wave (major effect) is released. The result is loss of fat. The dissolved fat cells are simply expelled from your body through your urine, which allows you to continue with your normal day-to-day activities,
                            additional exercise is required alongside the treatment in the form of a brisk walk or change in lifestyle (such as taking the stairs instead of the lift).</p>
                        <p>Cavitation treatment does not require any special pre-treatment. It starts with circumference measurement of the target body area, continues with circular movements of the applicator over the treatment site, and is finalized with
                            another circumference measurement. The duration of a treatment session can vary from 15 to 30 minutes depending on the size of the area and the thickness of the fat layer.</p>

                            <p>Ecstatic with the 3 inch loss from my first treatment, and will be back for more! Met Rachel for the first time when my friend had her first treatment. I was interested but sceptical and wanted to see the process and results
                                for myself. Rachel had no issue with this and answered all of my many questions while I watched her every move. My friend lost an inch on her first session and I saw the skin tone and fat distribution change for myself.</p>
