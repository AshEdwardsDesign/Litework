                    <p>Retro gaming is a new and innovative concept that is being introduced to a large selection of venues throughout the UK. Pubs, Takeaways, Service Stations, Hotels, Fast Food outlets and more can all benefit from this this type of popular
                        vending machine.</p>

                    <p>Looking back at games of yesteryear there are so many people that enjoy from their childhood and at what better time to take a trip down memory lane than when you are waiting for food or enjoying a few drinks with friends. Challenge
                        yourself again at Pac-man, Mortal Kombat, Space Invaders and many more!</p>

                    <p>Our vending machines come wrapped and branded to give them extra appeal in the venues and to attract customers to this fantastic product. Set in prime locations such as pubs and clubs, service stations, takeaways and other outlets
                        customers can relate to the games on offer. We will supply everything you need and install all of your vending machines in such locations for you. With the minimum effort needed from you, this business is more like an investment,
                        as there are few hours’ work involved, as the vending machines do all the work for you!</p>

                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Absolutely NO selling”</strong></p>

                    <p>Our products are self-promoting and need little introduction to customers to explain what it’s all about. Your role is simply to call out to your venues on a weekly/fortnightly basis, collect your money and go to the next one!</p>
                    <p>We specialise in vending and, as many years of experience has shown us, we know the right products and where to place them in order to give you maximum rewards, for little input.</p>

                    <p>We recommend 20% commission per sale to the venue. This is what we will offer them to secure your venue.</p>

                    <p>But, here we will give you more conservative figures. The below figures are based on the amount of uses per day, with a cost of 50p per game or 3 plays for £1. Currently machines are producing much more than this but we like to be
                        conservative.</p>
