                    <p>Whilst several of our business models offer a website as standard (the basic package), several of our models (namely the vending business models) don't. Therefore if you'd like to add a website to your business package or upgrade from
                        the basic package, we have 3 tiers for you to choose from.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-brand-primary">Online Presence</h2>
                    <p>Our basic package includes a 1-page template website tailored to your industry. This includes a simple contact form and links to your Facebook and Twitter pages (if required). Simple amendments such as text and images are included.
                        You also get 1 email account included as standard.</p>
                    <p><strong>The basic package includes:</strong></p>

                        <li>Your own domain name (e.g. www.yourbusiness.co.uk) with the first 2 years included</li>

                    <p>Whilst our basic package includes a simple but attractive 1-page template to get your business started, for those of you that want a custom, modern and responsive website, our pro package is for you. Not only does the pro package offer
                        a completely bespoke website design of up to 5 pages (designed to your preferences), it also features a fully responsive design!</p>
                    <p>What does this mean you ask... have you ever visited a website on your mobile or tablet and found everything to be really "zoomed out" or small? Have you ever visited a site on your mobile or tablet and been sent to a "mobile" version
                        of the site that's a pain to navigate or doesn't feature all of the content of the "desktop site"?</p>
                    <p>Responsive design eliminates both of these issues with a single site that intelligently adapts it's layout and structure to fit perfectly on the screen size it's being viewed on. So whether your customers view your site on a tiny smartphone
                        screen or a 70" plasma TV, your site will look great!</p>
