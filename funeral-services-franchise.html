  <div class="col-sm-9"><p>It takes a particular kind of person to operate a modern funeral care business. It goes without saying that you need to have exceptional interpersonal skills to deal with vulnerable people at a time of grief and stress.</p>
  <p>But you also need to have the highest level of integrity, empathy and organisational skills. Our business values revolve around our maxim of care, respect and dignity… always. So it is vital that our franchise owners embrace the same high standards and dedication to customer excellence.</p>
  <p>The nature of our business means that our customers place a great deal of trust in us to provide the final farewell befitting the dearly departed. With that trust goes a high degree of responsibility.</p></div>

    <p>As a Franchisee of Funeral Care Services you will be committed to offering a service of excellence to the family & friends of the recently deceased. Using our own tried and tested business model, we will help and assist you in setting up and growing your branch of Funeral Services to become a highly reputable, well established and trusted local Funeral Care service.</p>
    <p>We specialise in the full set-up of this chosen Franchise, helping you to develop it into a fully operational business, including marketing, customers, training and most importantly know-how. We believe help and support is a key element in any new business and we are proud to supply this for as long as you need it.</p>
    <p>Initially, as a Franchisee of Funeral Services you will be the face of the business for your chosen territory; greeting members of the deceased and helping them to choose the right options for their loved ones passing. Until appropriately trained, including confidence and relative experience (normally 12 months), Head Office will undertake the “behind the scenes” work, such as body collection.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-9"><p>The market place is massive. Although losing loved ones is not a nice thing to endure, the reality is that it’s a common occurrence and as one life is gained, another is sadly lost. It is for that reason that you as a Funeral Service Operator can utilise the allocated territory to your advantage.</p>
  <p>Promoting yourself and expanding your service and likeability to Care Homes, local authorities and less directly-associated locations such as Libraries, corner stores and community posts will help in the promotion of your Funeral Services business.</p></div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-12">
<p>Franchising offers business owners a number of key benefits that don’t exist if you set up on your own.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The business model is already set up, tried and tested.</li>
  <li>The branding has been done.</li>
  <li>The marketing materials have been created.</li>
  <li>Successful sales and marketing strategies are in place.</li>
  <li>You benefit from better buying power.</li>
  <li>You have immediate access to unique and exclusive products and services.</li>
  <li>You are given full and ongoing training and support.</li>
  <li>We appoint a business support manager to help and mentor you.</li>
  <li>We work with you in your business during the early days to ensure you learn the routines and deliver the services required.</li>
  <li>We provide guidance on key ratios, statistics and key performance indicators to help you understand where you are getting it right and how to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are many other benefits, such as being part of a united network, regional and national conferences, meetings and lots more.</p>
<p>But the important thing is that you actually save money and time by investing in a Funeral Services franchise through the use of our knowledge, experience and tried and tested methods.</p>

<div class="col-sm-12">
<p>Starting your own business is one of the most important decisions you will ever make. Whilst running your own business is not right for everyone, for those who choose to and who follow a tried and tested formula, we would say franchising is the smartest way to get into business for yourself.</p>
<p>However, given the level of personal investment in time, money and effort, it also makes sense to make your choices based on a solid process. We have set up a 7 stage process to help both you and ourselves decide if this franchise is the right choice for both parties.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stage One – Research the opportunities</li>
  <li>Stage Two – Apply</li>
  <li>Stage Three – Initial Interview</li>
  <li>Stage Four – Due Diligence</li>
  <li>Stage Five – Second Interview</li>
  <li>Stage Six – Consult with professional advisers</li>
  <li>Stage Seven – The Offer</li>
</ul>
<p>**Please Note** Your application will be treated in the strictest confidence and you will be under no obligation or pressure to proceed.</p>

<p>So, simply by conducting an average of 2 Funeral services per week, your annual profits will total <strong>£122,200.00</strong>.</p>
<p>Subtracting the cost of rent, lighting and electricity for the shop front: £2,500 per month, this would leave you with a total profit of <strong>£92,000.00<strong> for the first year alone!</p>
<p>However, in reality and once firmly established, a busy funeral directors would comfortably look to conduct 3-7 funerals per week. Envisage the profit margins then!</p>
