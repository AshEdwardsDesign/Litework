  <div class="col-sm-9"><p>It takes a particular kind of person to operate a modern funeral care business. It goes without saying that you need to have exceptional interpersonal skills to deal with vulnerable people at a time of grief and stress.</p></div>
  <div class="col-sm-3"><img src="" alt="" class="img-responsive"></div>
</div>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12"><p>But you also need to have the highest level of integrity, empathy and organisational skills. Our business values revolve around our maxim of care, respect and dignity… always. So it is vital that our franchise owners embrace the same high standards and dedication to customer excellence.</p>
  <p>The nature of our business means that our customers place a great deal of trust in us to provide the final farewell befitting the dearly departed. With that trust goes a high degree of responsibility.</p></div>

    <p>As a Franchisee of Funeral Care Services you will be committed to offering a service of excellence to the family & friends of the recently deceased. Using our own tried and tested business model, we will help and assist you in setting up and growing your branch of Funeral Services to become a highly reputable, well established and trusted local Funeral Care service.</p>
    <p>We specialise in the full set-up of this chosen Franchise, helping you to develop it into a fully operational business, including marketing, customers, training and most importantly know-how. We believe help and support is a key element in any new business and we are proud to supply this for as long as you need it.</p>
    <p>Initially, as a Franchisee of Funeral Services you will be the face of the business for your chosen territory; greeting members of the deceased and helping them to choose the right options for their loved ones passing. Until appropriately trained, including confidence and relative experience (normally 12 months), Head Office will undertake the “behind the scenes” work, such as body collection.</p>

Although losing loved ones is not a nice thing to endure, the reality is that it’s a common occurrence and as one life is gained, another is sadly lost. It is for that reason that you as a Funeral Service Operator can utilise the allocated territory to your advantage.</p></div>
