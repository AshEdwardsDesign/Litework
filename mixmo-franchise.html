                    <h4><strong>THE PRODUCT</strong></h4>
                    <p>We are the sole importers and suppliers of this revolutionary, patented pic ‘n’ mix system, which is currently taking Europe by storm. Sales have increased by up to 50% since being introduced and we have just launched it here for the
                        UK & Ireland market. Our Mixmo module systems are the latest in hygienic, multi sweet dispensing units. There is nothing like our system and these machines are replacing the conventional, current, un-hygienic open hatch systems.
                        They dispense dozens of your favourite pic ‘n’ mix sweets in a convenient, hygienic way! This happens at the touch of a button from sealed compartments which no human hands can touch, or contaminate, the sweets inside.</p>
                    <p>We all love pic ‘n’ mix sweets, but we are put off by the fact that many hands have touched the sweets using the conventional systems that are available at the moment. The hatches open and the sweets are there to be handled in any
                        way people see fit. People handle them, put them back, drop them and pick them up off the floor, etc! There are more germs on the average hand from day to day living, than on a toilet seat...FACT! The hatches are constantly opened,
                        so this leaves the sweets vulnerable to airborne germs from coughs, colds and any other germs floating around, ready for you to come along and help yourself to these potentially contaminated sweets.</p>
                    <p><strong><u>NOT ANYMORE!</u></strong></p>
                    <p>Our system prevents this, as our compartments are virtually airtight and NO hands can contaminate the sweets inside. You simply hold the button for the sweet you require and it will dispense into the cup without ever being touched
                        by human hands.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“The only hands that will touch them, are yours!”</strong></p>

                    <p>Our product does all the selling for you; the venue will stock up and generally maintain the system, as you will show them how to do all of this as part of your training. Our Mixmo systems are very reliable and require minimal maintenance.
                        Of course you’ll be trained to ensure you can resolve any issues that may occur. We are here to support you all the way, so if you ever get stuck with something you can’t handle; we are here to ensure there is little or no interruption
                        to your income. Your job is mainly to re-order stock from us, and make sure your system(s) are maintained correctly by the venue, that’s it. The more venues you have the more sweets you will sell and the busier you’ll be! Use your
                        profits to rent more systems and expand your business.</p>

                    <p>Here are some figures, so you can understand the potential of this business.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Maximum reward for minimum hours”</strong></p>
                    <p>Your recommended mark up on pic ‘n’ mix sweets is 100% profit margin.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Here’s how it works!</strong></h4>
                    <p>Firstly, all systems are on a rental basis only, from £31 per week, over a 36 month period. This is because we need to keep a tight control on our systems, to ensure they don’t get into the wrong hands. This ensures “exclusivity” for
                        you! This means you can only operate our systems under our licence...</p>
                    <p>If your stock order costs you £500, you sell to the retailer for £1,000.00. Profit on this order is £500.00</p>
                    <p>Example: You pay an average of £5.40 per kilo, this varies on weight, but that’s your average! You sell to retailer for £7-8 per kilo; he sells to the end user for between £10 - £11 per kilo.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Potential Income from current sales figures in Europe:</strong></h4>
                    <p>Recently released figures from Europe show our Mixmo systems have increased sales up to 50% compared to the traditional “open bin” pic & mix currently being used in the UK. This just shows how popular our systems are...</p>
                    <p>Based on 5 systems:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Weekly average sales based on 100 kilos of sweets = £200.00 gross profit from 1 location.</li>
                        <li>5 locations = £1,000.00 per week.</li>
                        <li>Less rental on 5 systems of £200.00</li>
                        <li>Total gross net = £800.00 per week</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>That’s amazing profit for doing virtually nothing!</p>
                    <p>Just one system can make you £640.00 per month based on average sales...</p>
                    <p>Remember: This is a passive income; you don’t even have to re-fill the machines, as the retailer will do that. Your profit comes direct from the supply of sweets, which, as part of the agreement, they “Have to buy from you.” & “You
                        have to buy from us”. Therefore, you should look at this as an investment. You should have a return on your investment in your first year, and then the subsequent years are all profit!</p>
