                    <p>Welcome to our Hangover Patch business model. We specialise in the full setup of your chosen product into a fully operational business, including marketing, to get your new business off to the best start possible! We believe help and

                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Work for yourself, not by yourself”</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>The product</strong></p>

                    <p>This Hangover Patch contains 12 organic, all-natural ingredients. This powerful blend of vitamins, nutrients, and antioxidants is designed to keep you energised whilst living a busy and social lifestyle, promoting general health and
                        well-being. The vitamin B complex as well as many other nutrients can be rapidly depleted from the body whilst living an active lifestyle. The loss of these nutrients adversely affects the central nervous system, which can leave
                        you feeling run down. Our Vitamin Patch can help replenish these nutrients, thus potentially assisting the body in restoring its natural balance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Natural Ingredients</strong></p>
                    <p>We believe natural is the way to go so our Hangover Patch contains 12 natural vitamins antioxidants & nutrients including:</p>
                    <p>Acai Berry, Vitamin A, Vitamin B12, Vitamin B2, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B6, Folic Acid, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin B1 & Green Tea Extract.</p>

                    <p>Using our professional marketing team, we will arrange venues who wish to purchase your products from the display boxes in your chosen area. Dependant on how many venues you purchase, you will literally only be working a few hours
                        per month. There’s no overhead, you can operate from home and you won’t need much space; part of a small spare room, garage, or shed will do to keep some stock.</p>
                    <p>Our proven system is an excellent way to help get your new business off to the best start possible. You’ll meet some interesting people in this business, so it’s ideal for people who enjoy getting out and meeting people. Whether you’re
                        retired, semi-retired, or looking to start a new career, this is for you!</p>

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                    <p>If you purchase 20 venues, this means your products will be introduced to 20 different businesses!</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Profit of £2.00 per patch = £6.00 profit, per day per venue</li>

                    <p>That’s £3,600.00 per month for not a lot of work...</p>
                    <p>This is more of an investment than work!</p>
                    <p>Yes, selling only 3 products per day, per venue, can make you £3,600.00 per month. Just selling small amounts can give you a great passive income, and remember, you do not really have to work to receive this income!</p>
