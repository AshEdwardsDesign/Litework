                <h4><strong>What Is PAT Testing?</strong></h4>
                <p>PAT Testing (Portable Appliance Testing) is testing that portable electrical devices are safe for use in the commercial environment.</p>
                <p><strong>PAT Testing Legal Requirements</strong></p>
                <p>There is NO specific legal requirement to have your portable appliances tested.</p>
                <p>However, there IS a legal requirement for all employers and self employed people to make sure that their equipment is SAFE by the Electricity at Work regulations 1989 , which impose upon the employer the duty to check and inspect at regular
                    intervals all their electrical equipment and installations.</p>
                <p class="text-center"><strong>"The best way to do this is to inspect and test on a regular basis"</strong></p>
                <p>This demand for electrical testing and appliance testing could easily by filled by a PAT testing technician (you) after going through PAT training on one of our PAT testing courses.</p>
                <p>But remember, the law makes it quite clear that the employer or self employed person is responsible for health and safety.</p>
                <p>But if you are an employer and you blatantly ignore "health and safety" risks and then have an accident, you would certainly be in trouble!</p>
                <p class="text-center"><strong>"This is why most companies have their equipment tested on a regular basis"</strong></p>
                <p>Hence why there is excellent money to be made "Part Time" PAT Testing companies electrical devices with your own PAT testing service.</p>

                    <p>PAT Testing (Portable Appliance Testing) is simply testing portable electrical equipment is safe for health and safety reasons. Most companies take this very seriously, as their insurance could be invalid, and if a claim is made, and
                        faulty equipment was to blame, this could have serious implications for that business.</p>
                    <p>So, hence they have their equipment tested on a regular basis, usually every 6 months to 1 year, depending on usage and conditions.</p>

                    <p>To obtain 500 or 1000 items per week is not un-realistic, if you just sit and think how many businesses there are?</p>
                    <p>4.5 million in this country, how many are in your area? How many appliances does each one have?</p>
                    <p>Then you can see it is very realistic to easily obtain 200 or 300 items per week, that £200-£300 per week, working only a few hours per week in your own time!</p>

                    <h4><strong>WHAT IS AN ELECTRIAL PORTABLE APPLIANCE?</strong></h4>
                    <p>Any appliance which needs testing is anything with a plug attached to it. It should also be portable.</p>
                    <p>A Personal Computer for example, has a monitor, power lead, speakers and maybe an multi-socket extension to test.</p>
                    <p>Other examples include Kettles, Irons, Leads, Cables, Monitors, Treadmills and Printers.. the list goes on!</p>
                    <p class="text-brand-primary"><strong>Additional Earning Potential</strong></p>
                    <p>Another way to add to your income is to carry with you a supply of the regular everyday electrical devices that you will test on a daily basis, as many of them will fail and will need replacing or repairing. Kettles, toasters, irons,
                        leads, etc! Then if one fails you can supply them with a new one and make extra income. Many companies like the ease of this and the faulty or un-safe item gets replaced immediately.</p>
                    <p>Another good way to maximise your income is to contact your electronic local repair centre (We can do this for you) and arrange a deal with them to repair items that are faulty, like printers, computers, etc! These can be expensive
                        and companies like them to be repaired sometimes. Again, you simply take the item away for repair, the repair centre fixes it, they charge you the agreed price and you add on your profit for the price agreed with the company and
                        there you have it, another profit addition to your business. This way you offer a complete service to companies, from testing, repair and replacement!</p>
