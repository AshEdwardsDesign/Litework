Litework
========

Litework is a simple, lightweight, responsive and open source HTML5/CSS3 framework for creating websites.

<strong>Please note: Litework is not yet ready for a production environment without some tweaking and additions</strong>

Why Litework?
========

I created Litework for 2 reasons, firstly, to give myself a project to work on in my spare time whilst not actively working on websites, secondly, as a testbed for myself to learn more about web design & development and to have somewhere to apply and refine that knowledge.

Litework is not...

•    Expertly coded<br>
•    A competitor to those fantastic frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation<br>
•    Any good... at all ;)<br>

Development Roadmap
========

The development roadmap for the Litework framework can be seen on our public Trello board:
