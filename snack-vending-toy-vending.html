                    <p>Welcome to our Snack & Toy Vending business model. We specialise in the full setup of your chosen product into a fully operational business, including marketing, to get your new business off to the best start possible! We believe help
                        and support is a key factor in any new business and we are proud to say, that we supply this for as long as you need it, FREE of charge!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Work for yourself, not by yourself”</strong></p>
                    <p>We do not charge any royalty or license fees. It is YOUR business, fully outright. We simply set it up for you and guide you through all of the potential pitfalls, so you have the best chance to succeed. We make sure you don’t make
                        the mistakes that most people, who try to go it alone (due to a lack of experience) will make! We offer all the positives of a franchise, without all the complications normally associated with them. PRODUCT RANGES There are a wide
                        range of products you can sell from your vending units; snacks, sweets and toys. You can even (and we recommend it) mix and match stock so that your machines can cater to the widest audience possible. Visit the three product tabs
                        on this profile to see our range and machine options.</p>

                    <p>Most of us love to snack on crisps, biscuits, sweets, chocolate, etc... fact!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Kids love our toys, too!”</strong></p>
                    <p>So, we have compiled a selection of the nation’s favourite snacks and toys into tubs, which vend from two machines, one for all your sweets/toys and one for Pringles, one of the nation’s favourite crisps! Our machines are highly reliable
                        and require little maintenance.</p>
                    <p>Vending is a great business; provided, your venues are the right ones and the products you’re supplying are in-demand. Getting these wrong, can cost you!</p>
                    <p>We believe we have removed these worries with our Multi-Snack & Toy Vending business. With many different products to choose from, we are confident there is something for everyone!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Having multiple choices gives you greatly increased potential income”</strong></p>
                    <p>We will arrange all your venues for you using our professional sales team, with years of experience in selecting the right venues for your vending machines. Good footfall and 2 machines installed per site, means less travelling to
                        collect and restock, saving you £££’s.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Many products = more choice = more sales”</strong></p>
                    <p>Following our proven system (no experience required) you’ll be able to operate your own business with ease! Using our professional marketing team, we will arrange to have our products approved for venues in your chosen area. They will
                        agree to have your machines in their stores, pubs or offices, etc. So, all you have to do is, re-stock them when stock is low and collect your money. Dependent on how many machines you purchase, you will literally only be working
                        a few hours per month. There are no overheads, as you can operate from home and you won’t need much space, some space in a small spare room, garage or shed will do just to keep some stock.</p>

                    <p>With our proven, unique system, we will ensure your new business gets off to the best start possible.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Work in your spare, part or full time”</strong></p>
                    <p>Here are some figures so you can understand the potential of this business.</p>
                    <p>Maximum reward for minimum hours...</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Work in your own time”</strong></p>
                    <p>Cost prices here are an average as some cost more, some less, so your average price is £0.30p.</p>
                    <p>Cost prices: £0.30p</p>
                    <p>Retail prices: £1.00</p>
                    <p>Venue commission: £0.20p</p>
                    <p>Profit: £0.50p</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p>If you purchase our 20 machine package. This means your products will be introduced to 10 different venues; offices, pubs, shops, leisure centres, etc.!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“2 x machines in each venue”</strong></p>
                    <p>This is assuming you wish to purchase both Pringles & Sweet/Toy machines. We offer you the option to purchase just Pringles or Sweet & Toys, the decision is yours. Some people decide to just purchase Sweet/Toy machines, or just Pringles
                        and have them spread over more venues. We can arrange this for you, but additional costs may apply as there is more work involved for us.</p>
                    <p>Spreading machines over more venues does not necessarily mean you’ll make more money. More venues means more travelling time and additional/increased costs (i.e. fuel) and remember, the more products you offer in any one venue, the
                        more you will sell, as they’re entirely different products. However, the choice is yours.</p>
                    <p>Note: The following example is for demonstration purposes only, as we cannot guarantee a specific income. All sites will vary, some are better than others. This example is based on feedback from existing machines.</p>
                    <p>Remember; these are multiple product machines, so you’ll be selling dozens of different products in one venue.</p>
                    <p>Example: 20 x machine package</p>
                    <p>Selling 10 products per day = £5.00 profit, per venue</p>
                    <p>10 x Venues = £50.00 profit per day!</p>
                    <p>= £50.00 per day x 30 days = £1,500.00 per month, profit...</p>
                    <p>Just selling small amounts can give you a great passive income and remember; you do not really have to work to receive this income, it’s more of an investment than work!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“The profits are there and we’re here to show you how to get it”</strong></p>
                    <p>The base package includes 4x machines, (2 venues) from only £2,295+VAT</p>
                    <p>Note: Extra costs may apply if you want to spread your machines into more venues.</p>

                    <p>Note: The more machines you purchase, the much cheaper they become, as we can pass our savings on to you!</p>
