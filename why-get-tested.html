          <h2>Why Get Tested?</h2>
          <p>Stress can cause a range of health issues and a general deterioration of our health. Common indicators of stress are pains in the chest, lack of energy, loss of libido, wrinkles, bags under the eyes, increased/high blood pressure and poor memory. In severe cases, stress often results in a heart attack or stroke.</p>
          <p>A recent study by University College, London; found that through a combination of stress, aging, lifestyle and poor diet, arteries stiffen and reduce the amount of blood that gets delivered to our heart, brain and skin.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Starving the heart of oxygen can bring on a heart attack.</li>
            <li>Starving the brain of oxygen can bring on a stroke.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Altering Your Appearance</h3>
          <p>Appearance can also be altered by stress. Your skin loses elasticity, creating wrinkles. This is evident in the skin of people who smoke. When damaged arteries and capillaries deliver limited amounts of oxygen in the blood, skin rapidly becomes less elastic, leading to premature wrinkles and eye bags.</p>
          <h3>Our Test</h3>
          <p>Our Test is targeted towards the source of the problem. By testing our clients with the latest Class II device and then offering recommendations as well as natural supplements, in many cases we can help our clients to maintain their arterial condition and biological age. Stress is part of everyday life but the key is how to deal with it. By using the latest techniques, we can help support a healthy vascular system and heart.</p>
