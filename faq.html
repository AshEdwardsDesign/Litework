          <h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2>
          <h3>How effective is the treatment?</h3>
          <p>The treatment is very effective. Most customers experience results up to 12 shades whiter.</p>
          <h3>How long will my teeth remain white?</h3>
          <p>This depends on your diet; if you drink red wine and smoke then a 15 minute topup every 3 months is reccomended. Having a topup every 3 to 4 months will keep your teeth nice and white as stains do build up naturally.</p>
          <h3>Are there any special requirements post treatment?</h3>
          <p>It is highly advisable that for 24 hours post-treatment you avoid any staining food or drink. A diet of water and chicken/rice/pasta and other white foods is preferable. We will provide details of suitable food and drink at your treatment. </p>
          <p>In order to maintain tooth whiteness for as long as possible, staining food and drink (such as cola or wine) and smoking should be reduced to a minimum.</p>
          <h3>Is teeth whitening by a non-dentist legal?</h3>
          <p>Yes, teeth whitening by a non-dentist is perfectly legal provided the person is qualified and insured. Therefore Service Your Smile are legally allowed to carry out treatments.</p>
