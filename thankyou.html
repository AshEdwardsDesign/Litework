                    <p>If you are looking franchise opportunities, then you've come to the right place. Here at Readymade Business 4 U Ltd, we have over 10 years of experience in setting people up in business with our lucrative business models and through
                        advertising a wide selection of franchises through our national franchise advertising site.</p>
                    <p><strong>How do our business models vary from franchise opportunities?</strong></p>
                    <p>Taking your first steps when working for yourself can be a big risk and fairly daunting, however various business models exist out there which mean you don’t have to be alone and without support. Two of the most common options when
                        starting up a new business are business opportunities and franchises.</p>
                    <p>These two business models share a few similarities, however the differences can be quite dramatic (particularly on your wallet!); now, we’re not saying that franchising is a bad idea - it isn’t – but depending on the level of flexibility
                        you want and whether or not you want to share a brand name, franchising might not be ideal for you.</p>
                    <p>We specialise in the full set-up and marketing of business models, similar to a franchise but we have removed all the negatives normally associated with them. This means once we have fully set-up your chosen business package, you will
                        own the full rights to that business and you'll never have to pay any ongoing fee's, ever! We don't stop there, we will assist you with customers with any of our business packages and you will also receive full back-up and support
                        for FREE!</p>

                    <h4><strong>Why should I buy one of your business models instead of franchise opportunities?</strong></h4>
                    <p>Several reasons, firstly, you don't need to pay any ongoing fees or royalties, meaning that more of the profit/revenue you earn is kept in your back pocket. Secondly, we offer ongoing backup and support without charging for it. Thirdly,
                        once you purchase one of our business models, it's YOUR business, you're in control of every aspect of the business and are not subject to any strict guidelines or rules set by us.</p>
                    <p>So if you're looking for franchise opportunities and to be your own boss, simply speak to us, our business models might be just what you're looking for!</p>
