                    <p>The Chauffeur market place is massive and you only need a small portion to make an excellent living doing something you enjoy! People require private hire and chauffeur driven vehicles every day, whether it's a business man/woman needing
                        to go to the airport or maybe business meetings all day, they'll need your services.</p>
                    <p>Many business men/women don't need a full time chauffeur but do need one a few times a month, so it's much more cost effective to hire one, as and when required.</p>
                    <p>They would sooner hire a chauffeur driven car for many reasons: so they can work on the way or simply to take the stress out of parking, especially if they have a few places to go in the city where parking is virtually impossible!
                        Most celebrities are the same, just need one here and there, or maybe a regular member of the public would rather go home in a nice vehicle from the hairdressers than a standard taxi.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Just a handful of regular clients can give you an excellent income"</strong></p>
                    <p>You'll be flexible enough to offer private hire to someone who just wants to go home from the shops, to taking celebrities, business men/women to meetings, gigs, or even across country.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Whatever their requirements"</strong></p>
                    <p>Chauffeur/Private Hire services you can offer:-</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Corporate days – can hire you for hours or days, at a time</li>
                        <li>Celebrities</li>
                        <li>Airport transfers</li>
                        <li>Race days</li>
                        <li>Local people requiring luxury travel</li>
                        <li>Weddings</li>

                    <p>Essentially, anything that requires a nice, comfortable vehicle with a professional driver.</p>

                    <p>The average hourly rate is around £50.00 for standard everyday occasions. You can charge more for special events like weddings, late-night work and distance work to cover your expenses.</p>
                    <p>The longer they hire you for, the cheaper you should be...</p>
                    <p>Your mileage should be around 10 miles per the hour & £2.00 per extra mile.</p>
                    <p>E.g. A 10 mile round trip to the local Airport with traffic will take you up to 1 hour = £50.00. A 20 mile round trip (2 hours) = £100.00. These are standard prices across the industry.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"A normal taxi would charge similar prices for this service"</strong></p>
                    <p>Remember: It's your business; all prices are negotiable, so you can charge your own prices.At these guide prices there is plenty of scope to move if needed.</p>

                    <p>So, as you can see there's plenty of money to be made. Just working a 20 hour week can earnyou over £1,000.00 @ just £50.00 per hour! Not including night work, weddings etc!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"£1,000.00 per week for just 20 hours work"</strong></p>
                    <p>Of course you will incur costs, mainly fuel, insurance and any finance payment you might have, but remember, you are charging extra to cover any additional mileage!</p>
                    <p>Based on 30 miles to the gallon, your fuel cost per hour will be around <strong>£5.00</strong>.</p>
                    <p>So, 20 hours x £5 = £100.00 in fuel for a 20 hour week!</p>
                    <p>If you have a finance deal for your vehicle, take this into account.</p>
                    <p>Earning <strong>£900.00</strong> per week x 4 = <strong>£3,600.00 per month</strong>. Less insurance and finance payments @£500 = <strong>£3,100.00 take home.</strong></p>
                    <p>If you currently have a suitable vehicle or do not require finance, then the average insurance is £100.00 per month, so your take home will be higher.</p>
