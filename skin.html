          <p>Recently featured on ITV’s ‘This Morning’ and beloved by ‘A listers’, Carbon Laser Facial Rejuvenation is now affordable for everyone and gives your skin a new burst of life, restoring your youthful glow.</p>

          <p>Better still, this is a completely painless and non-invasive treatment and it focuses on stimulating natural elastin and boosting collagen production for more refreshed and glowing skin. It exfoliates to minimising pores and reduce the appearance
            of wrinkles. Skin tone is improved and more even as blemishes and acne scars are reduced, to reveal a new, more radiant you.</p>

          <h2>How does it work?</h2>

          <p>After we have talked you through your treatment, we will cleanse the skin to remove any makeup and provide the optimum base for the treatment. We will then apply a thin layer of carbon paste onto your skin, which is very quickly absorbed into
            your pores.</p>

          <p>We do this because when a thin layer of carbon is spread over the skin the laser is absorbed by the carbon, focusing on the epidermis layer.</p>

          <p>In removing the carbon the skin enjoys the benefits of a peel or exfoliation by removing the outer layers of dead skin cells. Often Blackheads and Whiteheads are removed by this technique and radiance is restored.</p>

          <p>The next stage is a second sweep with the laser which stimulates elastin and collagen production to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles while minimalising pores.</p>

          <p>Once the session is complete, the skin is cleansed, toned and treated with a serum that is rich in Vitamin C, to support the effectiveness of your treatment.</p>

          <p>There is no literally downtime and you can return to normal activities immediately after the treatment, although you should avoid exposure to the sun or using any Retinol treatments for at least 48 hours.</p>

          <h2>Why should I book this treatment?</h2>

          <p>To experience a new, refreshed you and to restore your “glow”</p>
