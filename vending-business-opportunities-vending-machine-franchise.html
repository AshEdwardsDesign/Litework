                    <p>Welcome to our Multi-Washroom Vending business model. We specialize in the full setup of your chosen product into a fully operational business, including marketing, to get your new business off to the best start possible! We believe

                    <h4><strong>THE PRODUCT</strong></h4>
                    <p>Vending is a great business; provided your venues are the right ones and the product you’re supplying is required. Getting this wrong can cost you! We have removed these worries with our Multi-Washroom Vending business. With up to
                        8 different products to choose from, we are confident there is something for everyone!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Multiple choices, give multiple incomes”</strong></p>
                    <p>We will install your machines using our professional sales team, with years of experience in selecting the right venues for your vending machines. A good footfall and 2 machines installed per site (one in the ladies and one in the
                        men’s), gives you less travelling to collect and restock, yet 2 different types of customer in one place.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Up to 9 x products, 2 venues = choice”</strong></p>
                    <p>We have sourced the best products from researching what people want and need when they're out and about. Then, we commissioned a machine that can reliably dispense them, time and time again, with little or no maintenance.</p>
                    <p>Put these two together, along with our expert sales and marketing, and you have a great business, ready to go, that requires little effort...</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“More of an investment than a business”</strong></p>
                    <p>We will install your machines in your chosen area, in venues we believe will give you a good return. If, for any reason, one venue under performs, we will simply replace it for you, FREE of charge, as part of our backup and on-going
                        support. We have dozens of products to choose from, if one product isn’t selling as well as you thought, simply change it for another!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Choice is everything – More choice – more profit”</strong></p>
                    <p>When people are out and about, our products can come in very handy indeed! I’m sure you yourselves may have bought one or two in your time! Following our proven system (no experience required) you’ll be able to operate your own business
                        with ease and simplicity, re-stocking your machines and collecting your money!</p>

                    <p>Using our professional marketing team, we will arrange to have our products installed in stores, pubs, clubs etc.! We offer them a 20% commission or they can choose a charitable donation, which works very well in offices. So, all you
                        have to do is re-stock them when the stock is low and collect your money. Depending on how many venues you purchase, you will literally only be working a few hours per month, unless you choose to purchase a lot of machines of course.
                        There are no overheads, as you can operate from home and you won’t need much space, a small spare room, garage or shed is ideal to store your stock.</p>
                    <p>You’ll meet some interesting people in this business, so it’s ideal for those who enjoy getting out and meeting people. Whether you’re retired, semi-retired, or just looking to start a new career, this is for you!</p>

                        with great footfall that would love our machines in their premises, as they offer such a great choice. Even if we came across a potential site with a typical condom machine installed, we have a good success rate of installing one
                        of our machines, as ours offer a much wider array of choice, so the venues understand they’ll make much more money if they have our multi-selling machines, rather than a single-selling unit.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Expand with more machines or simply operate in your spare time”</strong></p>

                    <p>Our metabolyser is a mouth spray with a fresh peppermint flavor that contains components to aid the body in the process of alcohol metabolisation and promote its elimination.</p>
                    <p>To explain how the metabolyser works we must start by letting you know that there is no product in the world that immediately decreases the alcohol level in the body, so do not be fooled by false promises of ingesting a product that
                        in a few minutes decreases the alcohol level in the body, because it is impossible! Nothing can lower the Alcohol level in the body, it can only be metabolised.</p>
                    <p>In other words, our mouthspray does not eliminate alcohol (no product does!) instead, it helps your body to metabolyse (i.e. get rid of) the alcohol in your body. Therefore promoting quicker recovery from alcohol and reduced hangover
                        time!
                    </p>
                    <p>Our metabolyser mouthspray is perfect for clubs and bars and is a fantastic seller in such establishments.</p>

                    <p>If you purchase our 20 machine package, which would give you 10 venues (one machine in the male and one in the female restrooms) the following example profit is possible;</p>
                    <p>Remember: these are multiple product machines. Up to 8 to choose from...</p>
                    <p>Selling just 5 products per machine, per day, averaging = £1.50 profit, per sale</p>
                    <p>That’s £15 per day x 10 venues = £150.00 profit per day across the board = £4,500.00 per month.</p>
                    <p>Lil-letsLess 20% donation/commission.</p>
                    <p>= £120.00 per day x 30 days = £3,600.00 per month</p>
                    <p>Even selling small amounts per day can give you a great passive income, remember; you do not really have to work to receive this income, it’s more like an investment...</p>
