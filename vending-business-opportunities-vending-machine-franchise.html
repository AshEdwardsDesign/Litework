                    <p>In order to procure the best sites possible we will offer them a 20% commission. This incentivises popular, busy venues to want to host your machines as they are not only offering a service but there is financial reward for them also. So, all you have to do is re-stock them and collect your revenue.</p>
                    <p>Depending on how many venues you purchase, you will only be working a few hours per month, unless you choose to purchase a lot of machines of course. There are no overheads, as you can operate from home and you won’t need much space, a small spare room, garage or shed is ideal to store your stock.</p>
                    <p>You’ll meet some interesting people in this business, so it’s ideal for those who enjoy getting out and meeting people. Whether you’re retired, semi-retired, or just looking to start a new career, this is for you!</p>

                <p>Selling just 4 products per machine, per day, averaging = £1.50 profit, per sale</p>
                <p>That’s £12 per day x 10 venues = £120.00 profit per day across the board = £3650.00 per month.</p>
                <p>Less 20% commission. (Commission based on takings not net profit) = £96.00 per day x 365 days / 12 months = £2,920.00 per month</p>
