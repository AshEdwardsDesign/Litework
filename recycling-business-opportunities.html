                    <h4><strong>THE NEED FOR REFUSE IS HUGE</strong></h4>
                    <p>Readymade Business 4 U has all the resources, skill and knowledge of this industry, which makes this business model a great success. The waste industry is one of the largest in demand, with councils currently not keeping up with the
                        demand and charging high rates for collections as they dominate the UK, along with many restrictions for commercial and residential customers. The public are looking for easier and cheaper ways to remove rubbish and to recycle.</p>

                    <p>The waste industry is a recession proof business. Small and large businesses still require their waste to be collected. RMB4U will help you achieve a secure future with a great income along with providing customers from day one.</p>
                    <p>As you are probably aware there are always national press articles and new programmes regarding the issues surrounding the waste industry or maybe this is something you have experienced yourself.</p>
                    <p>The waste demand is constant and will only increaseas time goes on. Local councils and private companies are constantly increasing their costs and reducing the amount they collect, which in-turn is affecting residential and commercial
                        customers all around the UK.</p>

                    <p>Lots of residential and commercial customers are having to revert to skip hire which can be highly expensive and which also requires permits in order to use. Other local landfills/waste centres now require permits and will charge you
                        to take your rubbish and this is not convenient for people to do. Many of those who need to transport rubbish to the centres do not even have transport!</p>
                    <p>Summer time brings extra waste, with items such as cuttings and garden foliage, winter time brings 60% more waste with the build up to the festive season and also don't forget the new year celebrations including pub entertainment and
                        the disposal of xmas trees.</p>
                    <p>Commercial businesses require collections on demand and the flexibility of a quick and easy service, without major costs. Commercial waste can vary from customers who require bins/recycling boxes and bag collection.</p>
                    <p>Lots of businesses require either weekly, fortnightly or even daily collections. Many of these businesses do not want to be tied into having a large bin when their waste varies on a weekly basis. This is where you come in and can provide
                        the flexibility and options that most suit their requirements.</p>

                    <p>RMB4U have the key to success in this industry and it is our aim to ensure you achieve the greatest possible start with the professional back-up and assistance you require.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"We assist and provide you with a minimum of £10,000 incontracts or 100 customers, including all appointments for contracts!"</strong></p>
                    <p>Approximate hours will depend on how close your nearest waste centre is. Disposal prices will vary depending on your area. Please contact the office to enquire on the local tipping costs for your nearest transfer/recycling centre.</p>

                    <h4><strong>HOW DO I MAKE MY MONEY?</strong></h4>

                    <p>Based on 1 tonne of waste it is easy to follow.</p>
                    <p>To dispose of 1 tonne of waste costs £80 as an example (this will vary depending on your area,but this figure is the market average). The average bag of waste from a customer will weigh approximately 3 kilograms for a £1 charge (any
                        bags exceeding this weight an extra charge will be applied accordingly).</p>
                    <p>Please Note: Digital weighing scales are included within the package.</p>
                    <p>333 bags @ 3kgs = 1000 kgs or 1 tonne</p>
                    <p>333 bags @ £1 each = £333 (less £80 disposal charges = £253</p>
                    <p>Collecting 1 tonne of waste per day, based on the above figures (5 day week) will generate a total profit of: £1265.00</p>
                    <p>This is just one typical example of the potential this business has.</p>
                    <p>Here is another example of a different more commercial day:</p>
                    <p>Remember: Commercial rates are generally less than residential, but are guaranteed with signed contracts and are worked out on the annual value... So you'll get a mixture of commercial & residential business.</p>

                    <strong>Monday Morning:</strong>

                    <p>Mr Smith started his rounds who were under contract at the local shop to collect 25 bags of rubbish from the 1100 litre bin they rent from him. This bin holds up to 30 bags of rubbish. Mr Smith charges the shop £16.50 per week for
                        the bin at a maximum weight of 80 kilos (any excess waste is chargeable at £1.25 per kilo).</p>
                    <p>Mr Smith then went on to collect from his other 10 contracted customers and collected a total of 200 bags of rubbish and each of these customers paid him by direct debit £16.50 each month. He now has on his van approximately half a
                        tonne of waste and has collected £181.50.</p>

                    <strong>Monday Afternoon:</strong>

                    <p>Mr Smith continues his collections with his recycling customers. 90% of all businesses now recycle their cardboard, glass, paper and tin. Throughout the afternoon, Mr Smith collects over 2 tonnes of clear glass and just over half a
                        tonne of cardboard. Once this has been weighed in at the transfer centre, he will receive a rebate of around £105.</p>
                    <p>He will also be visiting local mechanics, engineers and plumbers merchants for white goods and scrap metal.</p>
                    <p>This will be transported to a local scrap metal merchant where he will receive a rebate of between £60 and £120. This would be split with the waste producer for services rendered, clearing him an average profit of £45.50</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>He collected 295 bags of rubbish, weighing approximately 600kg's, or just over half a tonne of waste</li>
                        <li>Recycled 4 old boilers</li>
                        <li>His wages for one day (average) was £325.50</li>
                        <li>Tipping costs were £80.00</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Also note:</strong> Mr Smith has disposed of just under 1 tonne of waste and yet paid the full price. Most transfer centres will make an adjustment based purely on the weight</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Profit £245.50 for one day's work</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>Please note:</strong>
                    <p>Please note: Larger contracts such as hotels, shopping centres and nightclubs etc may require larger bins or other recycling facilities, but these prices are factored in when the contracts are obtained.</p>
                    <p><strong>Attention:</strong> These examples have been taken from existing business we have obtained for our current operators & typical contracts we have supplied to them.</p>
                    <p>Here is another typical example of a recent contract we have supplied:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>£375.00 per week</li>
