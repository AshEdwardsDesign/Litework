                        <p>I was one of the lucky ones to get free treatments and am very happy to say what a difference after just two sessions. It's amazing! The clinic is high spec and welcoming, not once did I feel embarrassed. Rachel is a very easy
                            person to talk to and understands what you hope to accomplish. If you've got a specific problem area you need sorted I whole heartedly recommend this treatment. No pain all gain. Thank you Rachel. Xx</p>

                        <p>At first I was sceptical of this and wouldn't personally buy it usually as I would think it was a scam but after having 2 sessions I've lost 2 inches off my stubborn lower stomach , Rachel is a lovely person and makes you feel
                            at ease in her own home. Would highly recommend.</p>

                        <p>Rachel is a good friend of mine and of course I was over the moon when she told me she would be starting her inch go Lipo business. I must say i was also very skeptical......so Rach gave me a free trial to proove what she was selling
                            was the real deal. I had a half hour session and to my amazement i instantly lost two inches. I couldn't believe my eyes. Not only did i loose inches but the non surgical lipo gave my stomach defined shape. I was so happy.
                            The next day i lost another inch on top!! As well as being ecstatic with the results. The clinic was relaxing and tranquil and Rachel was so welcoming and professional. Can't wait for my next treatment.</p>

                        <p>I have had 4 treatments on my backs of the thighs. The results were clear to see after one treatment smoothing out the appearance instantly. After the 4th treatment the skin looked smoother and I was able to wear my shorts on holiday
                            which was why I wanted the treatment in the first place Rachel was warm and comforting the whole way explaining what was going on and made my treatment really relaxing I felt at ease every time I went there. Would highly recommend
                            and can't wait to get my bum lift</p>
