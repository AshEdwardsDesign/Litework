                    <p>"I bought this business model from Readymade Business 4 U and I am very pleased with the sites they got for me. Readymade Business 4 U have been there 100% for me and i know i can contact them at any time with questions i may have
                        and they will be totally honest and up front with me. Overall the customer service was very good and I would recommend them to those looking for a readymade business."</p>
                    <p>Update</p>
                    <p>"I purchased the Mobile Phone Charging business model just over 6 months ago and have been really pleased with progress I have made within that time.</p>
                    <p>I have successfully attained over 35 advertisers for my machines already. I have a great pricing structure in place which starts at £7.70 per machine, per month and reducing to only £5 per machine per month if an advertisement is taken
                        out on all 12 machines.</p>
                    <p>This set-up has not only made selling the advertising much easier, but also rewards the customer of being displayed on over 10 machines in high footfall venues all over Essex.</p>
                    <p>I was also happily surprised with the revenue which has been generated by the charging units themselves. The monthly turnover provides me with a comfortable £750 per month and that is just for opening the machine 1 time per month.</p>
                    <p>As the New Year turns I will be in a position to look at expanding my current batch and hope to have well over 30 machines by the end 2012...</p>
                    <p>...I would like to thank Readymade Business 4 U for the help and support they have provided me and I look forward to a great New Year with my company, Mobile Chargers!"</p>

                    <p>Thanks for providing me with a great set-up in the vending industry.</p>
                    <p>I was constantly updated with the scenario and felt totally comfortable about the work they were carrying out. I was provided with some extremely good sites, such as The Indigo inside the famous Gate in Newcastle City Centre, pictured
                        here.

                    <p>Update from Michael Anderson...</p>
                    <p>I'd just like to keep you up-to-date with how my new business venture is going. The machines earn regular charging revenue and I have sold all the initial adverts. I'm now in the process of purchasing more machines, hiring a sales
                        manager as well as a sales team to push my advertising further to help get larger companies to advertise on my machines.</p>
                    <p>I see the true potential of this business and am very happy with the progress I have made so far.</p>
                    <p>Thanks again!</p>
                    <p>Some recent sales figures from Michael:</p>
                    <p>My machines are averaging £80 per machine per month (charging revenue); and I currently have 87 adverts on my machines, I'm charging £30 per advert per month. Giving me over £3,000.00 per month in total.</p>

                    <p>Thank you all for your help in setting up my Vending machines. You were all great to get along with and have given me an excellent little business which I can build on. I purchased my Vending business because I wanted an additional
                        income without having to put too much input into it, as I already run my own business and don't have much time on my hands. It's a geat product and a nice income for doing virtually nothing as the product sells itself. I'll be
                        looking at purchasing more machines soon.</p>

                    <p>I had been thinking of setting up a business, going through the franchise route. Alas, looking around at the various franchises available, the minimum spend required in setting up required quite a large amount of investment.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to Readymade Business 4 U, I've been given the opportunity to start up my own vending machine business using limited funds, with no on-going royalties to pay.</p>
                    <p>Having visited their office in Macclesfield, I had a chance to meet the guys and find out a bit more about the company and how they operate. They showed me the vending machines and answered all questions that I had.</p>
                    <p>After deciding that I'd like to proceed, the next steps involved deciding how many machines I wanted to purchase, filling in the application/order form and making the payment. Whilst waiting for the machines to arrive, Readymade Business
                        4 U were busy marketing and contacting various sites in my area to find suitable locations to host my machines (these also included any places which I already had in mind).</p>
                    <p>Within about 6 weeks from making the payment, the new machines had been tested, safety certified and were ready for installation. I was given a list of sites to choose from and the next day the guys from Readymade Business 4 U came
                        to install the machines. I met the guys during the installation of the final machine, where they gave me the keys, manuals remote controls to the machines. They also ran through and presented me with a training manual which included
                        guidance on how to proceed with the business, setting up invoices, a business bank account, VAT, etc. They also set up insurance for the machines and provided me with a business phone number which customers could contact me on.</p>
                    <p>I am now set up and running my own business. Since then, they have been on hand for support and to help me through any problems that I've had.</p>

                    <p>"After searching on the internet for a teeth whitening product to enhance my already established running beauty business, I came across Readymade Business 4 U. After the first email I was pleased at how helpful and professional the
                        team were. I had many questions which I felt I needed to ask and they were answered quickly and thoroughly. After completing my training and starting up with the teeth whitening I hardly do any other form of therapy now as I’m

                    <p>I first saw Readymade Business 4 U on the internet as I was interested in the Inch Loss Clinic model (not as a mobile business but in setting up a studio in a city centre location). After many initial phone calls which were handled
                        very professionally I bought the business model and have been very impressed by the backup service that Readymade Business 4 U have given me not only in the initial set up but in the follow up on obtaining the machine at a very
                        competitive price, company insurance & training for my staff and laterally the efforts of the marketing team in securing me many contacts to get my business name and service out into the market place via leaflet distribution &
                        retail store referrals.</p>
                    <p>Having had several previous businesses I could not have picked a better company for my first setup and cannot praise both the professionalism and expertise of the Readymade Business 4 U team highly enough!</p>

                    <p>After months of painstaking research and trawling through the internet looking for the perfect business model I came across Readymade offering a package to help me setup and start a fully functioning laser tattoo removal business.</p>
                    <p>Apprehensive at first, I decided to give Readymade a call to see what it was all about, I found all the team very knowledgeable, friendly and professional.</p>
                    <p>They all quickly put my mind at ease and explained in great depth how it would all go with the setup, training etc and within 3 months of the first call I was a fully setup operator earning money!</p>
                    <p>Don’t get me wrong, setting up a new business that you don’t really know anything about can be quite daunting and scary; and you certainly need the passion and drive to get things off the ground because at the end of the day you're
                        the one that has to make it work. But with Readymade by my side with the advice and guidance that I needed, it made the situation both manageable and organised.</p>
                    <p>I am 8 months into it now and the business is doing really well, It's nice to know that the Readymade team are still there for me if I need them for marketing, advice or just a friendly chat.</p>

                    <p>“Choosing RMB4U was the best thing I did as their 15 years+ of successful experience in setting up people in businesses really shows. They arranged everything for me. They offer a readymade business-in-a-box, including training, equipment
                        and on-going help and support. They helped me obtain customers from day one which was the greatest help, this pushed my business name out in the market very quickly and before I knew it my days were getting booked up very quickly.
                        I have lots of connections with local businesses thanks to RMB4U and I am on average doing between 5 to 7 treatments a day @ £50 per treatment.</p>
                    <p>The training covered everything from using the equipment, how to perform treatments, customers’ expectations to how to take payments and run my business successfully, they even helped with future plans about building my business and
                        how to expand. RMB4U was a great choice!”</p>

                        waste and the selling of tipper bins to clients for them to store waste. The team have provided us with all the back-up, support and training needed in order to establish ourselves in the field. Even now they are only a phone call
                        or email away if needed for advice or to sort out a problem.</p>
                    <p>Postcodes: Due to the help provided to us by the team, we service the following postcodes.</p>
                    <p>SA14</p>
                    <p>SA15 This gives us a large area in which to expand and gain even more customers and offers us a</p>
                    <p>SA17 Massive potential income...</p>

                    <p>I purchased a Waste Distribution business model in February 2010. I found the team professional and very helpful in the set up of my new business. The training was excellent and the staff very friendly. My business has gone fantastically
                        and along with the help from the Readymade Business 4 U team, I now have a steady client base which is growing.</p>
                    <p>I believe I now have a great future and its only been 3 months. I would recommend this business model and thank you to the team at Readymade Business 4 U/Waste Distribution for all their help.</p>

                    <p>I have only been in the field for a very short time but would like to share my experience to date regarding; Readymade Business 4 U.</p>
                    <p>Readymade Business 4 U have provided me with a great set-up in my business with fantastic support through every aspect, they even sourced and purchased a van on my behalf, going across the country to find the right one for me. The
                        training process was very professional and I was provided with lots of customers for my first week in the field. I also went away with a full training manual for back-up if I required it.</p>
                    <p>My first day in the field, they provided me with the following customers whom are yearly contracts for me now:</p>
                    <p>****************************************</p>
                    <p>1 x cardboard (4 lifts a week)</p>
                    <p>2 x 1100 litre bin collected each day</p>
                    <p>3 x Glass bin collect once a week.</p>
                    <p>Contract value £6800 per annum</p>
                    <p>***************************************</p>
                    <p>5 bags collected once a week</p>
                    <p>Cardboard collected twice a week</p>
                    <p>3 x Glass bottle bins collected once a week</p>
                    <p>Contract value £1056 per annum.</p>
                    <p>Total contracts on my FIRST day were £7,856.00</p>
                    <p>I would like to thank Readymade Business for setting up my business so quickly and providing me with customers straight away as promised. If I had done this on my own it would have taken me much longer, at a far greater cost and I
                        would not have had help and support throughout the challenging hurdles that I have come across. Without their knowledge and help, this probably would not have been possible.</p>
                    <p>I would recommend Waste Distribution to anyone who wishes to run their own waste management busines.</p>
                    <p>Update:</p>
                    <p>Since having excellent results with Waste Distribution, I have now purchased a second business, Restroom vending, and again you guys have done an excellent job with the set-up of my business and the results are very promising…</p>
                    <p>Thanks again!</p>

                    <p>Mr Roble came to Readymade Business 4 U and asked us if we would help him set up his waste business in London.</p>
                    <p>He needed a great deal of help as he was very hard of hearing but proved capable of running the business with the support and dedication of the Waste-Cycle team. The Readymade Business 4 U team had to overcome obstacles, such as the
                        communcation barrier, that they hadn't faced before. Only a team as dedicated to maintaining a positive relationship with their customers as the Readymade Business team could of helped Mr Roble build the succesful business he has
                        today.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are proud to say that a year has gone by and Mr Roble is running the business very successfully with our help. He has thanked us on multiple occasions for making him very busy and for the extra support we provide him on a regular
                        basis. With all the obstacles in his way and the success he has achieved, we are very proud of him and look forward to continuing our professional relationship for many years to come.</p>
