                        <p>I was one of the lucky ones to get free treatments and am very happy to say what a difference after just two sessions. It's amazing! The clinic is high spec and welcoming, not once did I feel embarrassed. Rachel is a very easy
                            person to talk to and understands what you hope to accomplish. If you've got a specific problem area you need sorted I whole heartedly recommend this treatment. No pain all gain. Thank you Rachel. Xx</p>

                        <p>At first I was sceptical of this and wouldn't personally buy it usually as I would think it was a scam but after having 2 sessions I've lost 2 inches off my stubborn lower stomach , Rachel is a lovely person and makes you feel
                            at ease in her own home. Would highly recommend.</p>

                        <p>Rachel is a good friend of mine and of course I was over the moon when she told me she would be starting her inch go Lipo business. I must say i was also very skeptical......so Rach gave me a free trial to proove what she was selling
                            was the real deal. I had a half hour session and to my amazement i instantly lost two inches. I couldn't believe my eyes. Not only did i loose inches but the non surgical lipo gave my stomach defined shape. I was so happy.
                            The next day i lost another inch on top!! As well as being ecstatic with the results. The clinic was relaxing and tranquil and Rachel was so welcoming and professional. Can't wait for my next treatment.</p>

                        <p>I have had 4 treatments on my backs of the thighs. The results were clear to see after one treatment smoothing out the appearance instantly. After the 4th treatment the skin looked smoother and I was able to wear my shorts on holiday
                            which was why I wanted the treatment in the first place Rachel was warm and comforting the whole way explaining what was going on and made my treatment really relaxing I felt at ease every time I went there. Would highly recommend
                            and can't wait to get my bum lift</p>

                        <p>I consider myself to be someone who doesn't fall for the hype surrounding the next new fad but I'm willing to do my homework and try almost anything at least once. This is why I've had treatment at inchgolipo. Rachel was fantastic
                            in reassuring me there was no pain and she was right. If you've ever had an ultrasound scan this is what it reminds me of. The gel and the probe over my tummy no pain. So I had one treatment on my tummy and was amazed. I've
                            gone back for more and more. I've had my whole tummy including c-section scar smoothed as well as my saddlebags. That and following a healthy eating plan I have lost approx 6 inches on my tummy and hips. The skin is smoother
                            on my stretch marks and it's so much firmer too. I've only had one treatment on my saddlebags and already can see a smoother silhouette in my jeans. The confidence it's giving me is something I wouldn't have expected unless
                            I'd had surgery but now I can't wait to have more more more as there's no limit to places I could have done. Ok maybe some limits but all I can say is thank you thank you thank you Rachel, you are a star.</p>

                        <p>So far I've had 3 treatments with Rachel, including a facial and two sessions on my stomach, brilliant results! Lost 3 inches in total off my stomach area and what's even better for me was it really helped medically with IBS. It
                            also reduced my streatch marks by 50%! Absolutely over the moon! Very clean, professional and friendly. What's best is the 3 inches have stayed OFF since my treatment in august, amazing! Thanks Rachel!</p>

                        <p>I thought I would try this lipo as I'm not as active as I used to be. Well I can honestly say I do look thinner and with a bit of self toning. The results are great. With the 2 free sessions, I had nothing to lose, financially
                            that is! Booked in for another 2 sessions and will be having more areas done as well. Highly recommended!</p>
