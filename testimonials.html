          <p>I loved the results, my teeth are so much whiter after the visit.

            <strong>Adam - Leicester</strong>
          </p>
          <p>I was amazed with the results. The service was excellent. To think my teeth are so white and no bleach or peroxide was used. I am so so happy.

          </p>
          <p>I have tried every home bleaching kit out there and nothing really worked. In just over one hour Service Your Smile took me from a dark shade 9 to a wonderful shade of negative 2.

          <p>I am really pleased with the results. The product worked on both veneers and my normal regular teeth. All my teeth are so much whiter.

          <p>Service Your Smile came to me where I work. As I am a full time model it's hard for me to find time time to go and get things done. I was a regular smoker until I had my teeth whitened. Now they are so white my smile looks perfect. I have referred
            my friends to Service Your Smile and now I have received a referral payment which has made me even more happier. Thank you!!!

          <p>I would strongly recommend to anyone who wants clean white teeth to use Service Your Smile. You will not be disappointed.

            <strong>Dipika - Leicester</strong>
          </p>
          <p>I have sensitive teeth and mentioned this to Service Your Smile before I was treated. It was fine and not a problem as they have products for people with sensitive teeth. Yes my teeth are 8 shades whiter too.
