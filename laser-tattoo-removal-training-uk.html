                    <p>A tattoo used to be a permanent and irreversible adornment to one's skin. However, in recent years dermatologic surgeons have developed safe and effective techniques to successfully remove unwanted tattoos. Patients request the removal
                        of a tattoo for a variety of reasons — social, cultural or physical. Some patients develop an allergic reaction to a tattoo several years after the initial application, because each tattoo is unique.</p>

                    <p>The most popular and innovative method for tattoo removal is laser removal. Lasers work by directing energy toward ink in the skin with highly concentrated coloured light beams. These laser beams break up ink particles into tiny fragments
                        which are later cleared up by the body's scavenging cells. This process of fragmenting the ink particles requires numerous sessions depending on the depth of the ink. The procedure is bloodless and no incisions are made. The laser
                        selectively targets the pigment of the tattoo without damaging the surrounding skin.</p>
                    <p>Prices on average are £50.00 for each session of the treatment with each session lasting between 15 and 20 minutes dependant on the size of the tattoo. Depending on the tattoo, several sessions may be needed to fully remove each tattoo,
                        which means plenty of repeat business.</p>
