                        and we are proud to say that we supply this for as long as you need it, FREE of charge!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Work for yourself, not by yourself”</strong></p>
                    <p>We do not charge any royalty or license fees.</p>
                    <p>It is YOUR business, fully outright. We simply set it up for you and guide you through all of the potential pitfalls, so you have the best chance to succeed. We make sure you don’t make the mistakes that most people who try to go it
                        alone (due to a lack of experience) will make! We offer all the positives of a franchise without all the complications normally associated with them.</p>
                    <h4><strong>THE BUSINESS</strong></h4>
                    <p>Our sandwich delivery business model is a proven business, which we have perfected using our unique, professional marketing team to ensure you have customers from day one! There are more and more offices and businesses turning up on
                        industrial estates, on the outskirts of towns due to the downturn in the high street. This has created an increased demand of convenient foods being delivered. Lunch breaks can sometimes only be half an hour, so by the time people
                        have made it to the sandwich shop and back, their lunch break is over. Let’s face it, people are lazy and if they can have it delivered, then great!</p>
                    <p>Our sandwich delivery business offers convenient sandwiches, drinks and snacks at competitive prices with great profits.</p>
                    <p>Working just a few hours per day, 5 days a week, using our pre-packaged sandwiches and ready made pies, sausage rolls, etc, means you don’t have to spend hours making them (unless you wish to of course). The sandwiches will be delivered
                        fresh to your door every morning and we will arrange for you to deal with a local butcher for your pies, etc.! We will also set up a trade card for a local trade discount center, so you can obtain drinks, crisps, etc at trade prices.</p>
                    <p>We will guide you through the full setup of your business and our marketing team will provide you with waiting customers from day one! You’ll have everything you need to be able to supply an excellent product to your customers, time
                        and time again!</p>
                    <p>The vans have built-in fridges and ovens, for drinks, sandwiches and hot pies, etc. We can even arrange for your van to be sign written, and our I.T department can even design your own branding if required. Our full package has everything
                        you’ll need to run your own business easily, and with our full backup and support, you’ll never feel alone!</p>
