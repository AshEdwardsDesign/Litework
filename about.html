                    <p>Hi, I'm Zara Marsh. The owner and treatment technician at SlenderWave.</p>
                    <p>I launched SlenderWave shortly after finding out that my employer of almost 10 years was making me redundant... just as I was due to return from maternity leave. This was a really scary time for me as my family and I were in the process
                        of moving house as well (bigger mortgage + 1 income lost = Aaargh!). However, I very quickly realised that it was probably the best thing that could have happened to me as I now have the independence and flexibility to work around
                        my family life and get the satisfaction of working for myself.</p>
                    <p>After I had my daughter, Leila, in November 2014 I suffered with really low self-esteem and poor body image. This dragged me down at times and made it difficult to motivate myself to exercise or stick to a healthy diet. I constantly
                        asked myself "what's the point?", "who's looking at me anyway?" and "how am I ever going to get back to the way I looked before?".</p>
                    <p>When I found out I was being made redundant, I started looking at options for launching my own business and came across Ultrasound Cavitation. Not only did this offer me a career opportunity that could suit my lifestyle and family's
                        needs, it also gave me the hope I so desperately needed to abolish my negative self-image once and for all! Now I'm finally shifting those stubborn pounds left from pregnancy and feeling more motivated to exercise, eat well and
                        generally live a healthier lifestyle and I'm feeling great for it!</p>
                    <p>I feel extremely lucky to have been given the push to do something I truly love, and for myself. I'm not sure I ever would have had the courage to do it on my own otherwise.</p>
