          <h2>The ultimate Teeth Whitening Experience by Service Your Smile</h2>
          <p>We wanted to realise the importance of a smile, a smile can give off many messages. So we decided to do some research. How does a smile make you feel? And how does a smile make others feel? Just by smiling I can make myself feel happy even when
            I’m not, I realised that a brighter smile can also make others happy and change the aura around me.</p>
          <p>A bright and confident smile made me feel attractive and doubled my confidence to talk to different people. I felt less stressful when I smiled and when I made other people smile around me. By smiling, I managed to make new friends and found
            new business opportunities.</p>
          <p>I’d make myself laugh by smiling, try it. But most of all while smiling, and watching others smile around me, I realised that smiling just felt good.</p>
