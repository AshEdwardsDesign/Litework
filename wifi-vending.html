                    <p>Our Wi-Fi vending unit is a new, innovative machine that can be installed into any public location that has an internet connection in order to provide their customers Wi-Fi access for a fee. Bars, Pubs, Hotels, Pool Halls, Gyms and
                        a large selection of venues throughout the UK could benefit from having this unit installed. There are hundreds of types of locations that are perfect for this type of service. The units are built specifically for ease of use for
                        your customers, with clear, simple instructions and tap-to-connect connectivity.
                        <p>
                            <p>In the modern times we live and the wide-spread use of mobile phones, tablet devices, laptops and more; the majority of people require access to the Internet, all day, every day. Whilst network providers can offer good data
                                packages, the use of apps and video streaming services (i.e. Youtube) and even general internet browsing, can quickly use up a persons data allowance and cost them a fortune.</P>
                            <p>Our Wi-Fi units offer a great service to customers whilst ensuring the venue can benefit financially as well.</p>
                            <p>Costing each customer £1 for a full 60 minutes (customisable) of internet access, this Wi-Fi service is good value for money for end users. Imagine the repeat and ongoing custom you could gain from these units!</p>

                            <p>Our products are self-promoting and need little introduction to customers to explain what it’s all about. Your role is simply to call out to your venues on a weekly/fortnightly basis, collect your money and go to the next one!</p>
                            <p>We specialise in vending and as, many years of experience have shown us; we know the right products and where to place them in order to give you maximum rewards for little input.</p>

                    <p>Being able to offer customers, guests or visitors (depending on the type of establishment), the use of an excellent-value-for-money Wi-Fi service, is not only a good service to offer but will likely keep customers in the premises for
                        longer, resulting in them spending more money.</p>
                    <p>Generally speaking, the larger the venue, the more time a customer is likely to spend in the premises and thus there would be increased need of this service.</p>
