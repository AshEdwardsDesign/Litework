                <div class="col-sm-9 sml-padded">
                    <p>Cavitation lipo is a non-surgical liposuction treatment. The treatment requires no anaesthetic, leaves no scars, has no discomfort, and no disruption to your daily activities or routine; it presents a risk-free alternative to expensive
                        liposuction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"The result is loss of fat"</strong></p>
                    <p>Most of us have some stubborn fat deposits that never seem to disappear no matter what your diet or how hard you work out.</p>

                <div class="col-xs-12 sml-padded">
                    <p>Cavitation is a natural phenomenon based on low frequency ultrasound. The energy in the form of heat (minor effect) and pressure wave (major effect) is released. The result is loss of fat. The dissolved fat cells are simply expelled
                        from your body through your urine, which allows you to continue with your normal day-to-day activities, additional exercise is required alongside the treatment in the form of a brisk walk or change in lifestyle (such as taking
                        the stairs instead of the lift). If the client does not want to, or can't exercise for any reason we have superb vibration plates which do the same thing as exercise to help disperse the fat out of their system.</p>

                    <p>Our cavitation treatment does not require any special pre-treatment. It starts with circumference measurement of the target body area, continues with circular movements of the applicator over the treatment site, and is finalized with
                        another circumference measurement. The duration of a treatment sessioncan vary from 15 to 30 minutes depending on the size of the area and the thickness of the fat layer.</p>

                <div class="col-sm-9 sml-padded">
                    <p>Ultrasound Cavitation is a technique that reduces body fat and allows cellulite to be removed selectively, safely and non-invasively. The machine uses low frequency ultrasound which is conducted through the skin to break up the fatty
                        tissue into a liquid substance. This liquid is then passed out of the body naturally through your urine. Our Inch Loss Clinic system also has wrinkle elimination technology, tightening and lifting to improve your skin after the
                        weight loss.</p>
                    <p>On average most people will only need 8 sessions in the desired area, although most people will want more treatments to remain at their desired weight, which means plenty of repeat business. Inch Loss Clinic recommends 2 sessions per
                        week, over a 4 week period. So at £50 (recommended) per half hour session, 8 hours will generate you £400 from each customer. This is amazingly cost effective when you compare it to traditional liposuction, which costs thousands,
                        is painful and involves surgery. This makes it much more affordable to people than traditional liposuction.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>People look to lose weight before they go on their holidays</li>
                        <li>Brides may need to fit into their dress before the big day!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Repeat business is guaranteed as most people tend not to stick to their diets, as they know they can call you to nip round for a session and remove any fat they put back on! Also, what tends to happen is the customer will see the results
                        from one area and then want other areas doing. This causes a snowball effect which is fantastic for repeat business!</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fact! Over 90% of women, all shapes, sizes and ages, suffer from cellulite. Cellulite is the name given to lumpy, irregular fatty deposits</li>
                        <li>Cellulite begins to form during puberty, but it's not always noticeable on younger women because their skin is more supple</li>
                        <li>Cellulite also affects men as well</li>
                        <li>Our Liposuction Cavitation is a great procedure for those "hard to target" areas like the stomach, thighs, hips, arms, buttocks and even love handles!</li>
