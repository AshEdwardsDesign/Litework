                    <p>To bring UK law in line with EU requirements, The Cosmetic Products (Safety) (Amendment) Regulations 2012 came into force on 31 October 2012.</p>
                    <p>The legal position on cosmetic tooth whitening in England and Wales is now as follows:</p>
                    <p>Products containing or releasing less than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide continue to be available to patients (as previously).</p>
                    <p>This means that according to teeth whitening law this process falls under the EU Cosmetics Directive (implemented in the UK by the UK Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 1996). In simple terms, the ruling meant that dentists and
                        non-dentists could both perform teeth whitening treatments without breaking the law.</p>
                    <p>Even with this in force, the General Dental Council (GDC) continuously made quite shocking lies in the press and media which claimed it was illegal for non-dentists to whiten teeth. This desperate action made a lot of people loose
                        respect for such an organisation.</p>
                    <p>The GDC claims that they have successfully prosecuted 2 tooth-whitening providers. The truth is that these providers were not prosecuted only for doing teeth whitening. One was prosecuted for making false statements in regards to the
                        qualifications of the staff in his clinics (he claimed on his website that they were dental professionals but they were not, which clearly breaches section 38 of the Dentist Act of 1984). The other one was prosecuted on public
                        health grounds.</p>
                    <p>Products containing or releasing less than 0.1% of hydrogen peroxide, including mouth rinse, tooth paste and tooth whitening or bleaching products are safe and will continue to be freely available on the market,</p>
                    <p>The same ruling referred to the above House of Lords ruling on the 28th June 2001 in the case of Optident Limited and another Vs. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, stated that a cosmetic product cannot release more than
                        0.1% hydrogen peroxide. On the 15th March 2005 this limit was increased by the European Commission and Scientific Committee on Consumer Products, to products which release more than 6% Hydrogen Peroxide. However has since been
                        reduced to 0.1% for non-dentists.</p>
                    <p>However this was soon superseded by the ‘The Cosmetic Products (Safety) Amendment Regulations 2012’ (implementing Directive 2011/84 EU which amends Directive 76/768/EEC) which came into force on the 31st October 2012.</p>
