                    <p>Lotto vending is a proven concept, just like all of our products, and it has taken off across the UK. Our machines vend tickets at £1 per ticket and the prizes vary from £1, £5, £10, £20, all the way up to £500.00. At 50% pay-out,
                        this will keep your customers coming back, again and again! Lotto tickets are a proven winner and will offer you a great income for doing virtually nothing. Your machines will do all the work for you. We will set-up all of your
                        venues for you (pubs, clubs, etc.) and negotiate any terms. These types of venues are certain to get footfall from people who will purchase tickets, time and time again. Full training is given to ensure you can empty and maintain
                        your machines without fuss. Simply re-order tickets from us, as and when you need, and we’ll send them direct to your door.</p>

                    <p>Lotto tickets and scratch cards are big business. 99% of people still play after winning and there are thousands of people playing each week in the UK. Many of us enjoy a flutter and our Lotto Vending machines take advantage of this.
                        As soon as the venue starts paying out prize money, word spreads and sales can increase rapidly.</p>
                    <p>By providing scratch cards from our vending machines, siting the machines in the right venues and with them being quick and easy to buy, they are proving very popular.</p>
                    <p>“Little work required – let your machines work for you”</p>
                    <p>Using our professional marketing team, we will arrange to have your machines sited in pubs, clubs etc. We will offer some venues a 20% commission and others a 20% charity donation to cover you legally.</p>
                    <p>You’ll meet some interesting people in this business, so it’s ideal for those who enjoy getting out and meeting people. Whether you’re retired, semi-retired, or just looking to start a new career, this is for you!</p>

                    <p>The tickets cost you £170 per box of 2,800 tickets, delivered to your door!</p>
                    <p>The tickets retail at £1 each and 50% is paid out in prize money, leaving a gross profit of £1,400.00.</p>
                    <p>Less 20% to the venue or your charity and less the £170 to purchase a box, will leave you a net of <strong>£950.00</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Your profit per ticket, works out at £0.34p per ticket sold, after all your expenses have been taken out. So, simply x £0.34p by how many tickets you sell and that’s what you make.</p>
                    <p>The following is based on average sales. We have not used exceptionally high or low sales, simply the average you can expect to earn to be as up-front and as fair as possible.</p>
