                    <p><em>Amino boosters</em> – Amino acids are the basic building blocks of all proteins in the body. These amino boosters use pure Norwegian YTE® which is a highly absorbable bioavailable source of the 22 amino acids most required by the
                        body. These are the best value amino boosters available on the internet.</p>
                    <p><em>Frequency wristband</em> – The brain’s frequencies are known to control our performance, stress, anxiety and creativity and are tuned to the pulse of the earth. Modern life means that we are constantly surrounded by man-made frequencies
                        from things such as mobile phones, electrical cables, satellite signals and more. These wristbands are designed to channel natural frequencies directly into the wearers biofield helping to realign any energetic imbalances.</p>
                    <p><em>Meditation wristband</em> – Meditation takes time and discipline to master before you really feel the benefits. Many people become frustrated and give up. These bands resonate a series of frequencies that tune you into a meditative
                        state within minutes. Allowing beginners to skip the learning curve and quickly experience the benefits of meditation. Experienced meditators will feel they are to go deeper with ease.</p>
                    <p><em>Drinkifi frequency coaster</em> – Drinking plenty of water is important for our health and can assist hugely in getting best results from ultrasound cavitation treatments. However, some people don’t drink as much as they should
                        as they don’t like the taste of normal tap water. The drinkifi coaster emits 30,000 natural resonance frequencies that change the structure of the water making it taste smoother, more like spring water.</p>
