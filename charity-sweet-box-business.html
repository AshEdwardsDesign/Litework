                    <p>The product</p>
                    <p>We all love snacks, crisps, biscuits, sweets and chocolate, etc. So we have created a fantastic business that includes all your favourite snacks!</p>
                    <p>Add to that the fact that you are helping your chosen charity, and you have a great little business that can easily make you £9000.00 a month. Your job, is to simply visit the places that we have arranged to have your charity sweet
                        boxes, top up your stock and collect your money. You give the chosen amount to your charity and that's it. A simple, effective and profitable business with a great passive income for virtually doing nothing and, helping your favourite
                        charity at the same time!</p>

                    <p>Using our professional marketing team, we will arrange venues who wish to purchase your products from the display boxes in your chosen area. Dependant on how many venues you purchase, you will literally only be working a few hours
                        per month. There’s no overhead, you can operate from home and you won’t need much space; part of a small spare room, garage, or shed will do to keep some stock.</p>
                    <p>Our proven system is an excellent way to help get your new business off to the best start possible. You’ll meet some interesting people in this business, so it’s ideal for people who enjoy getting out and meeting people. Whether you’re
                        retired, semi-retired, or looking to start a new career, this is for you!</p>

                    <p>Your business will advertise using a charity box, which is based on honesty. Unfortunately, sometimes, the wrong amount will go into the box and can affect the exact amount but, most people are honest so this should not happen too
                        often. If it does, we are happy to replace that venue FREE of charge!</p>
