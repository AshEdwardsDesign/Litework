                    <p>The UK coffee industry is worth £6.2 billion, without including tea, chocolate or soups and is continuing to grow rapidly.</p>
                    <p>Every day, many people repeatedly consume these types of drinks and with most people living a busy lifestyle; repeat business is guaranteed (which will give you a secure future). Our machines provide a fast and convenient way to supply
                        them with the drinks they require.</p>
                    <p>Businesses love our machines for the simple reason - time is money! In larger organisations, employees can waste valuable time making a Tea or Coffee, especially if they’re making 10 cups for their colleagues. Another reason for our
                        machines’ popularity is that the maintenance/ingredients are provided by yourself, so this saves time for the business as they don’t have to source and purchase stock. Businesses using traditional coffee machines end up paying
                        for the drinks (as they allow staff to use them for free). Using our machine, the employees have to pay for their drinks; it not only saves time and money, but looks professional; especially if on display in a customer-facing area
                        such as a waiting room, reception or lobby.</p>
