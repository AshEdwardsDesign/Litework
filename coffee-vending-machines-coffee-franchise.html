                    <p class="text-center"><strong>Absolutely no selling...</strong></p>
                    <p>Full training is provided so that you can maintain, re-stock and collect your money from the machine(s) with ease.</p>
                    <p>We supply you with FREE initial stock (if purchasing 2 machines or more) to give you an instant return on your investment, plus profit from day one! Full back up and support is free of charge for as long as you need it.</p>

                    <p>The UK coffee industry is worth £6.2 billion, without including tea, chocolate or soups and is continuing to grow rapidly.</p>
                    <p>Every day, many people repeatedly consume these types of drinks and with most people living a busy lifestyle; repeat business is guaranteed. Our machines provide a fast and convenient way to supply them with the drinks they require.</p>
                    <p>Businesses love our machines for this simple reason; “time is money”! In larger organisations, employees can waste valuable time making a Tea or Coffee, especially if they’re making 10 cups for their colleagues. Another reason for our machines’ popularity is that the maintenance/ingredients are provided by yourself, so this saves time and money for the business as they don’t have to source and purchase stock. Businesses using traditional coffee machines end up paying for the drinks (as they often allow staff to use them for free). Using our machine, the employees have to pay for their drinks; it not only saves time and money, but looks professional; especially if on display in a customer-facing area such as a waiting room, reception or lobby.</p>
                    <p>We can supply machines to the following locations;</p>

                        <li>Offices</li>
