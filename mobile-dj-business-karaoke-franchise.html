                    <p>Our DJ/Karaoke business opportunity is a fantastic and very profitable business that can be run in your spare time and, simply put, can make you hundreds of pounds’ profit in just one night.</p>
                    <p>From your regular pub gigs and birthday parties to weddings or private functions, there is literally never ending, repeat business waiting for you to turn up and give your customers a night to remember. Following our proven system
                        and training (no experience required) you’ll be able to operate your own Karaoke/DJ system with ease! You don’t need to be an extrovert to be a DJ or a fantastic singer to operate the Karaoke system. All your clients want is good
                        music played to suit their requirements. When it comes to Karaoke, sometimes the DJ will spend all night singing so the guests don’t get a chance to have some fun. If you’re not confident singing, sit back and let your customers
                        sing their hearts out! After all, that’s what they’ve paid for!</p>
                    <p>There are no overheads, as you can operate from home and you won’t need much space. A small spare room, garage or shed is sufficient to store your equipment.</p>
                    <p>We will supply you with everything you’ll need, from superb, professional equipment, to full training on how to use it, even a comprehensive system on how to be a good DJ. We will even supply you with a full marketing campaign in your
                        chosen area, using our proven referral system and professional sales team; this will help generate you customers on a regular basis. Using our referral system, we will help your business get off to the best start possible. Our
                        experience tells us that the initial marketing is very important for any new business, so we are here to help. Local businesses will promote your services for a small commission. This should ensure regular business, which does
                        not cost you anything, you only pay them the commission on results! A win-win situation for you! They advertise your business for you and you only pay them once the booking has been completed.</p>
                    <p>This, combined with your website that we will design for you, plus, your own efforts, i.e. simply letting your friends know, advertising on Facebook/Twitter and your friends doing the same, it’s amazing how social networking will spread
                        the word about your new business. We will guide you through this if you don’t understand how it works.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Before long, you’ll have regular, repeat business”</strong></p>
                    <p>Our system is an excellent way to help get your new business off to the best start possible. You’ll meet some interesting people in this business, so it’s ideal for those who enjoy the outdoors and meeting people. Whether you’re retired,
                        semi-retired, or just starting on a new career, this is for you!</p>
