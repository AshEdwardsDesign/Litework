                    <p>Mobile phone charging vending is currently very successful in Asia and the United States. Now it’s proving to do the same in the UK & Ireland. Our advertising screens are a different and unique concept in comparison to your “standard”
                        vending machines. What makes these machines unique when it comes to vending is; “you can get involved”. This enables you to generate a serious income and you do not require hundreds of machines to do it. We currently have operators
                        with only 5 machines making £3,000.00 per month & more!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“If they can do it, so can you with our help”</strong></p>
                    <p>They’ll charge 95% of all mobile phones. The only phones they won’t charge are the older models that are no longer common. Simply plug in your phone, put £1 in and you’re away! Customers can use their phones immediately if they have
                        an emergency call/txt to make.</p>
                    <p>Whilst their phone is charging, they will be looking at very lucrative advertisements that are on your machines. Creating a captive audience in-turn helps to sell advertising as local businesses can see the benefits of a low-cost,
                        unique advertising method that reaches out to huge audiences.</p>

                    <p>Mobile Phone Charging Stations are located and installed by us into venues in your chosen area. Everyone has run out of charge at some point or another whilst out and about. Imagine having 5, 10 or 20 of these stations in and around
                        your local area, all collecting £1 per charge every time someone needs to use them. Not only will these machines offer you the traditional ease of collecting your vending revenue, but with the addition of digital advertising screens,
                        this is a unique and very profitable way of increasing your revenue.</p>
                    <p>Local businesses will pay you to advertise on your stations, usually £5, £10, £20 per month, or more, dependent on how many stations you have. It’s so cheap to advertise on these stations compared to, say, your local newspapers’ classified
                        ads, so you’ll easily sell your advertising space and local businesses will have a cheap form of advertising that literally thousands of potential customers will view each week.</p>
                    <p>The adverts rotate on a slideshow 24/7, every minute of the day or for as long as the venue is open for. Also, understand the additional benefit of having your own advertising business, especially if you have other businesses. If you
                        feel like you wish to operate your own business, with very little effort, but for maximum rewards; then this opportunity is for you.</p>
                    <p>Readymade Business will ensure that your products are marketed to the right venues in your chosen area. In order to ensure the right locations are obtained we will offer the venue 20% of the COIN revenue only. For a prime location
                        to be interested in hosting one of your machines it is imperative they get something in return. Ultimately they are offering an extra service to their customers which is of high benefit but 20% of the coin revenue would be the
                        deal breaker. In the illustrative figures below we reflect those calculations.</p>
                    <p>Please Note: The commission payable to the venue is based on the COIN revenue and NOT the advertising revenue.</p>
                    <p>It only requires a little extra effort at the beginning, but has massive potential...</p>

                    <p>Remember: The more advertisers that you fill your machines with the more in demand your product will be. Businesses need to advertise locally, and at £10 - £15 - £20 per month, your machines will be full in no time!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Digital advertising is the future”</strong></p>
                    <p>Remember: Your machines will display adverts 24/7 or for as long as the venue is open. They will sell advertising space for you but slower than selling space yourself! If you do not wish to sell advertising space yourself, or you are
                        not confident then why not look to outsource the job to a marketing agency. There are many large marketing companies and self-employed tele-canvassers that would be happy to sell the advertising for you. Based on a split commission
                        you are generating adverts and income without having to make as much as a phone call!</p>
                    <p>The more charging stations you have, the more revenue you'll receive, the more advertisers you’ll have and the higher the premiums you can charge!</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>We can send out a new machine almost immediately. Our engineer can fix most problems over the phone with you, if not, the callout can take a few days, depending on how busy we are. We recommend all operators carry a spare machine to
                        avoid any interruption, having said that, these machines are very reliable and almost never go wrong, unless vandalised - which is also very rare.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>Adverts are supplied via email. Most companies will already have an advert ready to go in JPEG format. You simply download this to a USB stick and upload it to the machine, very easy and full training is given. It’s just like using
                        your home DVD player.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>Subject to the size of your order, on average around 6 to 8 weeks, mainly to secure good venues for your machines and not to rush into the first ones that come along. Please note that the advertisers we acquire have agreed to a 1 month
                        free trial of their advert. After 1 month you should contact them to see if they wish to continue on a paid-for basis.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>We currently run over 18 opportunities, if you allow us to place these on your machines (optional) we will pay you up to £1,000.00 in commission for any sold from your machines. Your 0843 number will be placed on the machines, so they
                        would call you directly, you’ll then be able to keep track of our inquiries. You pass on the inquiry to us, we do everything else and if they sign up, we pay you. Easy money for doing nothing. You can set your adverts to run from
                        2 seconds to 10 seconds each.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
                    <p>No, 2 is the minimum order. This business works on numbers. Ideally, you’ll need to purchase 5+ machines. This will give you the best possible returns from the beginning. Especially with the advertising side, as feedback suggests,
                        advertisers like more machines to get value for money and this also makes selling the ad space easier.</p>
