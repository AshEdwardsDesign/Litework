                    <h4><strong>THE PRODUCT</strong></h4>
                    <p>Mobile phone charging vending is currently very successful in the Far East and the United States. Now it's here proving the same in the UK & Ireland. Our advertising screens are a totally new and unique concept to hit these shores,
                        and not just another vending model. What make these machines unique when it comes to vending is;</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"You can get involved"</strong></p>
                    <p>This gives you the potential to make a serious income and not having to have hundreds of machines to do so. We currently have operators with only 5 machines making £3,000.00 per month & more!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"If they can do it, so can you with our help"</strong></p>
                    <p>mobile phone charging franchise</p>
                    <p>The only phones our Mobile Phone Charging Stations won't charge are the old ones that nobody really has anymore. All our charging stations can be upgraded at anytime, simply and easily if new phones arrive. Simply plug in your phone,
                        enter £1 and you're away!</p>
                    <p>Customers can use their phones immediately if they have an emergency call to make. While their phone is charging they will be starring at a very lucrative advertising screen. These adverts are on a constant rotation and are seen by
                        potentially thousands of people per week, passing through these busy premises we install them in.</p>

                    <h4><strong>THE BUSINESS</strong></h4>
                    <p>Our Mobile Phone Business Model is unique because it has 3 potential income streams, vending, advertising and commission!!</p>
                    <p>Mobile Phone Charging Stations are located and installed by us, in local venues in your chosen area, near you. You will probably know your area better than we do, so if you wish (optional) nominate any sites, venues, you would like
                        your stations to be installed in, and we will approach these sites on your behalf, and do our best to place them there. If not, don't worry, just sit back and let our specialist team do their work. We have access to all the business
                        data in your area. So, you do not have to approach them, we'll do everything for you!</p>
                    <p>Everyone has run out of charge at one point or another while out and about. Imagine having 5, 10 or 20 of these stations in and around your local area, all collecting £1 per charge every time someone is running low, or runs out of
                        charge. Not only will our Mobile Phone Charging Stations offer you the traditional ease of collecting your vending revenue, but they also have digital advertising screens, which bring you the unique opportunity of a greater additional
                        income. You are in total control of this part of your vending business and, unlike our competition, this allows you to be more in control of how much income you can generate.</p>
                    <p>You can significantly increase your revenue by selling advertising space on your Mobile Phone Charging Stations. This revenue is simply paid to you by standing order, on a monthly basis for doing virtually nothing.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Selling the advertising space is easy"</strong></p>
                    <p>Local businesses will pay you to advertise on your stations, charging them just £5, £10 or £20 per month, depending how many stations you have. It's so cheap to advertise on these stations, there is no real reason not to advertise,
                        especially because so many people can view these adverts in busy premises.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Think about it"</strong></p>
                    <p>How many people will pass through busy pubs, clubs, shopping centres, etc on a weekly basis? Hundreds, even thousands depending on the venue and how many venues you have! There are literally billions of mobile phone users around the
                        world.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's much cheaper to advertise with you on your stations, than say, your local newspaper classifieds. So, you can easily sell your advertising space to local businesses, even without any experience, as we will show you how to do it.
                        All you have to do is pick up the phone and let them know what you can offer them!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"An excellent, cheap form of advertising"</strong></p>
                    <p>Potentially thousands of people will see these adverts each week. The adverts show on a constant rotational basis, 24/7 if the venue is open that long.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Your charging stations will also advertise for advertisers"</strong></p>
                    <p>mobile phone charging business modelWe will upload adverts onto your Mobile Phone Charging Stations, these adverts will advertise for new advertisers! Obviously, it makes sense to do this so your charging stations are working for you
                        day and night to generate more advertisers.</p>
                    <p>If you feel like you wish to operate your own business, with very little effort, but for maximum rewards or even if you've been interested in mobile phone franchises in the past...</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Then this business model is for you!"</strong></p>
                    <p>It only requires a little extra effort at the beginning, but has massive potential.</p>

                    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Your machines will advertise for advertisers, 24/7 for you or as long as the venue is open. They will sell advertising space for you but slower than selling space yourself! But, if you do not wish to sell
                        advertising space yourself, why not ask a person who is unemployed, or someone who is at home all day, or the odd day, if they want to earn commission for selling your ad space. They'll be glad of the money, as it's easy to sell,
                        and this way it does not cost you anything.</p>
                    <p>"Remember": The more Mobile Phone Charging Stations you have, the more revenue you'll receive, the more advertisers you'll have and the higher premiums you can charge!</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer</strong> - Yes, we know they do, but just ask yourself "would you use this machine?" and the answer is, YES! People gather round them just to try it out, others would like to know if it's safe to drive. The advertising
                        sells, as its cheap and has a massive potential for local businesses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer</strong> - We have a good rate of installation, without having to pay any commission. But, if they do insist, we offer them 20% of your usage (Breath test only, not advertising) revenue. We will liaise with you to make
                        sure you're happy, if not; we can move on to another venue. Remember; certain venues are worth paying commission to, plus, you'll sell more advertising space for more money to compensate you for any loss in commission.</p>
