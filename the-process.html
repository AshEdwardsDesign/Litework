          <p>In order to start the treatment we will take your teeth shade so that the difference your treatment has made can be measured. You will also need to fill out our consent form which will allow us to carry out the whitening of your teeth.</p>
          <h3>Step Two</h3>
          <p>You will be taken to one of our comfy beds where you will open your prefilled mouthtray, place on your protective goggles and place the tray into your mouth. One of our clinic staff will then turn on the LED light which activates the gel in
            your mouthtray. The activated gel will proceed to break down the stains on your teeth. Once the 20 minutes is complete, you will remove the tray and rinse off the gel accompanied by one of our staff. This is repeated dependant on the package
            you have chosen.</p>
          <h3>Step Three</h3>
          <p>Once your treatment(s) are complete, we will retest the shade of your teeth and show you the difference! How do I decide which treatment to go for? â€“ For those who have never had their teeth whitened or are frequent smokers or wine drinkers,
            we recommend the double or the Triple treatment. As our teeth whitening process is made up of 20 minute treatments, you can decide after each treatment if you would like another!</p>
