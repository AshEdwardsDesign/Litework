                    <p><strong>How does the business work?</strong></p>
                    <p>Simple… we supply you with everything you need to run your own local cleaning business, in your own designated area. We even assist you with customers and a tendering contract with one of the largest contract tender companies in the
                        UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>We will supply you with your own accounts manager who will look after you and inform you of upcoming tenders in your area. This could lead to many contracts in your area from companies, simply because you can be competitively priced
                        due to your low overheads. Don’t forget large companies will not even look at below threshold tenders… but you will!</p>
                    <p>Imagine placing bids for upcoming contracts with these types of companies;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Central Government</li>
                        <li>Ministry of Defence</li>
                        <li>NHS</li>

                        <li>Schools & Colleges</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The list goes on and on and all these different tenders come in on a regular basis. Imagine having a local tender accepted with your local council…. Game over!</p>
                    <p>This proves without a doubt, this business really works! We supply you with a fantastic cleaning machine, which fits into the back of your van or trailer, complete with its own water tank, power generator, and it’s fully portable,
                        making you self-sufficient. This makes you very attractive to people and companies who cannot be there for whatever reason. The unit enables you to do multiple cleaning jobs, so you are much more versatile… Think of all those different
                        tenders you can apply for, having this type of multiple cleaning system the possibilities are endless!</p>
                    <p><strong>Part Time or Full Time</strong></p>
                    <p>It’s your business, so you decide whether to work a few hours a week making a few hundred pounds, or full time making thousands per month. Expand your business using our superb referral system or handing out the leaflets we supply
                        you, don’t forget recommendations from existing customers, as this will happen on a regular basis.</p>
                    <p>We also supply the sign writing for your van, which will advertise for you as you go about your daily routine. People will literally walk up to you in the street and ask you to do some work for them, simply because you look so professional
                        in what you are doing. All of this helps to build up your business.</p>
                    <p>The Multi Clean business model is based around six main items:-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Window cleaning</li>
                        <li>Conservatories</li>
                        <li>Car / Caravan valeting</li>
                        <li>Carpet Cleaning</li>
                        <li>Wheelie bin’s</li>
                        <li>Path’s & patio‘s</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So the customers we assist you with will want one or more of these items cleaning. As you get to know your customers, they may ask you to do other things for them (it’s your choice if you wish to expand your cleaning services or not).</p>
                    <p>Full product training is included. Once you're set up, you simply call on the customers we supply to you and they will tell you what they require and your business builds from there...simple!</p>
                    <p>Expand or don’t, earn hundreds or thousands, it’s up to you! ...And “No Royalties”!</p>
