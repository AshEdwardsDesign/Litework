                    <h2><strong>Here’s what franchisee’s have to say...</strong></h2>
                    <h3>Richard Johnson</h3>
                    <p>Domino’s Pizza franchisee Richard Johnson is an example of an entrepreneur who took the plunge and decided to take his career in a new and tasty direction.</p>
                    <p>With over 20 years’ experience in IT, Richard had worked for a range of companies providing the infrastructure and support for them to grow and improve their customer service. His most recent role saw him working for a company, which
                        grew from 30 staff to 5,000 and expanded into 13 countries worldwide.</p>

                </div>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8">

                    <p>Throughout his IT career, Richard always had an interest in running his own business and a keen eye for opportunities. When his last IT role came to an end, Richard decided he wanted to pursue his dream to run his own business as a
                        fulltime career and began looking into franchising.</p>
                    <p>Richard explains: “My corporate background had really given me a sense of the power of a good brand. I knew that if I wanted to run my own business as a fulltime career, I could achieve much more with a well-recognised franchise than
                        starting up on my own.”</p>
                    <p>Having made a shortlist of franchises, Richard chose Domino’s Pizza for its proven business model and the great opportunities it offered for growth. Richard took ownership of the Domino’s store in Southport in July 2009 and quickly
                        after, added Domino’s in Crosby to his pizza empire.</p>
                    <p>“Running my own Domino’s franchise is everything I’d hoped it would be,” he continues. “It’s really hands-on and it is very satisfying to see how the decisions I make have a direct impact on my stores. Domino’s offers the best of both
                        worlds – I own my own business but I know I also have the backing of a national company with a very successful brand. It’s an ideal combination as it means I can get on with running my business but, at the same time, benefit from
                        national marketing activities such as high profile TV sponsorships, which is something I’d never have been able to achieve as a start-up.”</p>
                    <p>Richard is relishing his new career and in the future, hopes to expand his franchise to ten stores.</p>
