                    <p>Grand usage total in 1 month = £608.00 based on only 5 machines</p>
                    <p>Adverts sold in a 4 week period: 20. That's just 4 per week @ £20 each = Total £400.00 in advertising revenue in 1 month, which will now repeat every month on top of your usage revenue.</p>
                    <p>That's £1,008.00 in 1 month, selling only 20 adverts!</p>
                    <p>Once established, using the same usage figures as above, with 100 adverts at only £20 each (Below average) = £2,608.00 per month with only 5 machines! Imagine how much you'd make with 10-15-20 machines or more!</p>
                    <p>Please note: These are easily achieved figures.</p>
                    <p>These machines are currently earning over £200.00 per month, each, in usage revenue alone! So, if you don't fancy selling your advertising space, just sitting back and allowing the machines to do all the work, 5 machines can easily
                        earn you over £1,000.00 per month, virtually all you'll have to do is collect it…</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"The machines will sell your advertising space for you"</strong></p>
                    <h4><strong>Advertising:</strong></h4>
                    <p>This is repeat business, so once you have sold all your available adverts (100), they repeat every month. 1 or 2 may cancel occasionally, which you simply replace. But most stay on, as its very cheap advertising for the audience that
                        use, or pass by these machines every day! We install your machines in very busy footfall areas. Local businesses will recognise these places and understand the passing footfall and the fantastic response these machines receive.
                        So, all in all, along with the very cheap prices, they would be foolish not to want to advertise with you! Most businesses already have their advert ready to go, which they email to you and it's uploaded via a USB stick… simple!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"These machines can operate 24 /7, so if the venues are open 24 hrs, people are seeing the adverts every hour of everyday"</strong></p>
                    <p>This is a great selling point, and we'll show you how easy these adverts are to sell. Full instructions will be given, and provided you're happy to pick-up the phone, you'll sell these adverts!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Let someone else sell your ad space for you, if you don't wish to do it yourself"</strong></p>
                    <p>Everyone knows someone who is unemployed or maybe a stay at home mum, who'll gladly sell your advertising space for you, offer them a commission, so it will cost you nothing!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"We will provide you advertisers to start you off, so from day one your machines will be attracting new advertisers"</strong></p>
                    <p>Alcohol Breathalysers machines will also advertise themselves for new advertisers. We will put adverts on your machines, advertising for new advertisers! So, even while you're asleep or just enjoying quality of life, your machines
                        will be working for you in every way!</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer</strong> - Yes, but the size will depend on how many machines you order, you decide how large your area will be, by your order. Order more machines and we will increase your area.</p>

                    <p class="text-brand-primary"><strong>Question - How much commission will I have to pay the venue to host my machine?</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Answer</strong> - We have a good rate of installation, without having to pay any commission. But, if they do insist, we offer them 20% of your usage (Breath test only, not advertising) revenue. We will liaise with you to make
                        sure you're happy, if not; we can move on to another venue. Remember; certain venues are worth paying commission to, plus, you'll sell more advertising space for more money to compensate you for any loss in commission.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer</strong> - Not much at all, these machines have hardly any moving parts, so they are very reliable and you only have to fill them with straws when you empty your money every few weeks, so that can't be bad.</p>
