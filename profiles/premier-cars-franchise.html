                    <p><strong>Latest Positive Figures For Franchise Businesses From NatWest Franchise Survey</strong></p>

                    <p>While other sectors have struggled in recent years, the NatWest BFA Franchise survey records some positive news. Growth, job creation and exporting are all mentioned! While UK GDP grew by 0.7% in 2011, the franchise industry increased
                        economic contribution by 8% as turnover rose to £13.4 billion.</p>
                    <p>9 out of 10 franchise businesses posted a profit over the year – reducing loss-makers to pre-recession levels. Further growth is likely, as 76% of those surveyed expect business to improve in the coming months.</p>
                    <p>80% of franchisees believe that franchising gives them a competitive advantage over other small businesses, as they have the support of a larger brand.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-brand-primary"><strong>The Story of Premier Cars</strong></h2>

                    <p>I started many years ago with an old Vauxhall Omega, sitting on the Taxi Rank, working for another company. I soon realized my dream of “Upper Class Private Hire”. It took months of planning - quite a daunting task to set up your own
                        business and to get it running smoothly. Two years later my wife joined me in the business and it went from strength to strength with top quality cars and drivers. It worked really well for us and after years of building up the
                        business, I now concentrate on helping Franchisees establish their business.</p>
                    <p>If you have the personality and determination to succeed, I would get a lot of pleasure in helping you achieve your goals. We are down to earth business people - no fancy offices - no secretaries. We just do it all ourselves.</p>
                    <p>"Have you been made redundant, taken early retirement or are young and outgoing and wanting to make a career in the business? Whatever your circumstances, why not make your future look brighter and consider coming on board with us
                        as a Premier Cars Franchisee?"</p>

                    <p><strong>Price:</strong> £3,500.00</p>

                    <h2 class="text-brand-primary"><strong>Cost of Private Hire Licence</strong></h2>

                    <p><strong>Private Hire Licence:</strong> £193.00 for 3 years</p>
                    <p><strong>Operators Licence:</strong> £90.00 for 3 years</p>
                    <p><strong>DBS Check:</strong> £59.00 for 3 years</p>
                    <p><strong>Medical:</strong> £90.00 depending on Doctor</p>
                    <p><strong>Vehicle Plate:</strong> £109.00 Yearly</p>

                    <p>These figures are based on North Dorset District Council, Blandford, Dorset. Other Councils will vary.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-brand-primary"><strong>Potential</strong></h2>

                    <p>It is possible to achieve a turnover of £40,000 in your first year with one car. The profitability on these figures is likely to be about £27,000 depending on the individual’s circumstances i.e. Bank Loan, Car Finance, etc. This makes
                        a Premier Cars Franchise extremely attractive and affordable.</p>
