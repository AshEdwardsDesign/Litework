                    <p>Owned by YUM! Brands - the globes biggest restaurant company, Pizza Hut is the largest pizza business on the planet with over 13,000 restaurants worldwide. This, as a franchisee, gives you access to world-class business resources,
                        backed by more than 50 years of experience and innovation.</p>
                    <p>Started in 1958 by Frank and Dan Carney, with the support of a $600 loan from their mother, Pizza Hut grew from 1 restaurant in Kansas to 1,000 across the US by 1972. Pizza Hut Delivery (UK) Ltd is building on this success with its
                        national franchise programme, which in the UK, originally began in 2001. Our franchised delivery estate is now in the region is now in the region of 260 units and is set for explosive growth in a pizza and pasta delivery market
                        that is continuing to experience healthy expansion. In the 5 years to 2012 the total value of the market is expected to rise almost 20% to £857m, and this is on the back of a 38% rise during the previous 5 years.</p>
                    <p>We’ve always been at the forefront of innovation in the pizza market – regularly introducing items like Cheesy Bites and The Calzone that demonstrate our appetite for offering our customers exciting new ideas. We’re proud of this and
                        for our reputation of delivering piping hot, quality food – on time, every time, to customers in every corner of the world and we’d like you to feel that pride too.</p>
                    <p>In the next few years we plan to open over 200 Delivery Huts and are actively recruiting new franchisees across the UK to meet an increasing demand for the Pizza Hut Delivery experience. A successful Pizza Hut franchisee is a special
                        type of person. You’ll need drive and self belief – and you’ll have to give up your time to build the business. So give it serious thought before applying: We’ll require 100% dedication and passion from you and in return you’ll
                        own a business associated with a globally recognised brand, providing support in:</p>

                    <p>Your training begins during the selection process. Potential franchise partners are given the chance to get hands on with the business by going in store for a day. This gives you a chance to go through the administration, processes
                        and systems etc you would need to replicate as a Pizza Hut Delivery Franchisee. It also enables you to experience the operation in full swing. This way you get a feeling for what it’s like to be in one of our outlets, and whether
                        or not you are comfortable working in such an environment.</p>
                    <p>We know we can only deliver faultless day-to-day operations if the team looking after our customers has the right skills. As a franchisee, you will complete a dedicated training programme tailored to your needs. On the whole, training
                        usually takes place over two - three months and comprises a mixture of theoretical and practical coaching including a comprehensive in-store training programme, supplemented by classroom sessions at one of our nationwide training
                        centres.
                    </p>

                    <p>These are exciting times in Pizza Hut and we need franchisees with the ambition and drive to succeed and grow their business to multiple outlets in a relatively short space of time. We have a great team here waiting to support you
                        on your journey.</p>
