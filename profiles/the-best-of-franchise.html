                    <p>thebestof was was launched in 2005 by serial entrepreneur, CEO of N5Ltd and author of the best selling business book 'Botty's Rules' Nigel Botterill. Nigel began his entrepreneurial career as a consultant before launching My Mag a
                        'business in a box' inspired by his wife Sue. Within 3 years they had helped set up over 1,000 local community magazines across six countries. It was immediately apparent that whilst the magazines were great, the world was beginning
                        to move online.</p>
                    <p>Nigel and his team were the first to react; they began developing thebestof. The impact of thebestof was immediate and dramatic. thebestof was the first national independent web, directory competing with the likes of Yell and Thompson
                        and people loved the concept and simplicity of the model.</p>
                    <p>An ever evolving organisation, in the summer of 2007 the N5 team and some the organisations top performing franchisees developed a completely new proposition for thebestof, that quite simply blew all competition 'out of the water'.</p>
                    <p>thebestof franchisees are now able to offer their business members a complete marketing solution including,online, direct, outdoor media and network marketing solutions. In fact there is suite of marketing tools unique to thebestof
                        that form the offer the franchisees take to their business members. thebestof continues to go from strength to strength with Nigel and his team amassing a cupboard full of awards along the way.</p>

                    <p>"What matters most is that each franchisee is a proper people person." (CEO Nigel Botterill)</p>
                    <p>Because Nigel offers a £3000 per month profit guarantee, he is extremely choosy about who he accepts as a franchisee - its a people business after all. After seven strong years, thebestof team know well the characteristics required
                        to become a successful franchisee. thebestof's application process may be rigorous but new franchisees don't necessarily need sales experience or technical skills. "What matters most that each new franchisee is a proper person,"
                        says Nigel. If your bright and switched on, unintimidated by hard work to get started and you're passionate about making a positive difference to your community, then thebestof could be the perfect franchise opportunity for you.
                        As a thebestof franchisee you'll become a 'word of mouth specialist' in your local area - a key influencer in your local business community.</p>

                    <p>£150,000 per annum by year two is "really achievable" (Simon Jones, franchisee for thebestof Colchester since 2012)</p>
                    <p>The great thing is that with this business,what you earn is really up to you. Your earnings will depend on a number of things, like your work ethic, the time you devote to the business, (and how effectively you spend that time), the
                        way in which you deploy the techniques you are taught and, of course, your existing skills, experience and contacts. Your core income will be from the monthly membership payments made to you by local businesses. Because of the
                        multi-faceted approach of the bestof there are also additional revenue opportunities available to franchisees. After 2-3 years, when you've got 200 featured businesses your regular monthly income should be heading north of £11,000
                        each month. Remember: residual income is a beautiful thing.</p>
