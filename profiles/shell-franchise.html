                    <p>Petrol stations are no longer just about selling fuel - customers can experience a range of products and services, provided by people who take the time to understand their needs. It's not just our relationship with Ferrari that makes
                        Shell service stations the front-runners of retailing. With over 56,000 outlets serving some 25 million customers globally, we're offering a multiple investment opportunity that's nothing short of world-class. We're constantly
                        working to improve our business and have recently added more than 250 new sites to our UK network. Consistent, top quality customer service is at the heart of what we do. That's why we're looking for bright, ambitious, business-minded
                        people to help take our business to new levels of success. </p>

                    <p>Running one Shell service station is a major commitment. Running a cluster is an even bigger one. Many of our service stations are open 24/7 and 365 days a year so even when you're not on duty, you'll need to be confident that your
                        team can maintain world-class service standards.</p>
                    <p>That will put your powers of leadership and ability to delegate to the test. Highly motivated and well organised, you'll set the standard for the business under your control. You'll therefore need to be the kind of person who can inspire
                        professionalism, and yet still get on with all kinds of people - not least your customers. Remember, gaining their repeat business will be absolutely vital to your success - it will be up to you and your team to win them over.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-brand-primary"><strong>The Opportunity</strong></h2>
                    <p>As a self-employed retailer, you'll bring your skills, business approach, enthusiasm and your commitment. We, in return, supply the service stations, which are going concerns, the fuel, support and a full retailer-training programme.
                        In short, we'll be working together to grow the business within an honest, open environment.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Running a business cluster as a self-employed retailer, you'll receive commission on all fuel sales as well as income from all shop and car wash sales. You will be expected to pay agreed royalties to Shell.</li>
                        <li>Grow the business and exceed estimated sales while controlling your costs and your income will increase accordingly.</li>
                        <li>You own the shop stock and set your own prices up to certain maximum limits.</li>
                        <li>You employ and manage your own staff.</li>
                        <li>Shell determines the core product range within the shop, but you will be able to include some agreed local ranges and set your own prices up to certain maximum limits.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-brand-primary"><strong>Returns On Your Investment</strong></h2>
                    <p>Your income will depend on the type of Shell service stations you run and their locations, but you can look forward to potential earnings of between £70,000 and £90,000 per annum from year one (for a cluster of six sites), with the
                        opportunity for additional earnings if you exceed targets and control your costs. Earnings and numbers of sites may vary and are not guaranteed. We will require security in the form of a bank guarantee; the amount can vary depending
                        on the cluster characteristics and the results of your credit assessment (a minimum of £50,000 but an average of £100,000 for 6 sites). Working capital of at least £50,000 will also be required to fund your business, in order to
                        purchase initial shop stock.</p>

                        deposit of £10,000 will be refunded when you complete your training and pick up the keys to your cluster of sites. As you progress, we'll develop your abilities through a series of tailored training courses.</p>
