                    <p>We’ve developed an unbeatable turnkey package to allow you to hit the ground running and which costs £19,999+VAT for a Mobile Engineer. </p>

                    <p><strong>This includes:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Exclusive marketing rights in your chosen territory of 180,000 population.</li>
                        <li>A comprehensive PC Repair tool-kit including laptop, software, diagnostic tools and initial stock of parts.</li>
                        <li>A marketing and launch plan tailored to your area - we don’t have a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach like some franchises.</li>
                        <li>Your first directory adverts for Yellow Pages, The BT Phonebook and Thomson Local.</li>
                        <li>Our unrivalled step-by-step training and support package with on-site experience included.</li>
                        <li>Dedicated and comprehensive online knowledge-base built from 1000s of hours of real-life, on-site problem solving.</li>
                        <li>Technical support over the phone and online whenever you need it, so you never feel on your own.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Hub Managers can bolt-on additional territories for just £10,000 + VAT, giving exclusive marketing rights in a further 180,000 population. 'Marketing' and 'Engineer' bolt-ons can then be purchased as and when each area comes on stream,
                        thereby improving cash-flow during the expansion phase.</p>
