          <h2>Who can we help?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Anyone with a heart pumping blood around their body needs this test</li>
            <li>See the signs before you feel the symptoms!</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Gyms / salons / health practioners</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Partner with us to offer this valuable service to your clients</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Business Organisations</h2>
          <p>More companies are recognising the importance of offering high quality health screening as part of their company benefits programme. Your business can partner with Health Check North West to promote prevention screenings to your employees. Our
            business partnership programmes are flexible and can be conducted at your workplace.</p>
          <h2>Options</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Flexible benefit schemes:</strong>Tax-efficient ways in which your employees can choose health screening services and pay for them out of their pre-taxable salary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Self-pay schemes:</strong>Where you can offer your employees access to screenings at special corporate rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Company paid schemes:</strong>If you as the employer pay for the screening, all assessments can be offset against tax on your company profits. The health screening can be delivered at your convenience and at your own premises.
          </p>
          <h2>Benefits to Your Company</h2>
          <p>Employee screening and workplace health promotion can offer significant benefits to your company.</p>
          <p>Imagine an employee has unrecognised high blood pressure and slow developing damage to arteries and major organs that one day results in a serious heart attack requiring a long stay in hospital, intensive medical and surgical treatment and extended
            rehabilitation.
          </p>
          <p>If the high blood pressure and perhaps vascular stiffness had been detected early at a workplace health screening, the employee could have been supported to maintain good health and the employer would avoid lost productivity.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Businesses already offering this service find lower rates of staff sickness, better performance and productivity, as well as increased staff loyalty.</li>
            <li>As an employer, you will be all too familiar with increasing Health & Safety legislation demanding that companies demonstrate that they are taking measures to look after their staff, including their health needs.</li>
            <li>Health screening can be offset against tax on your company profits and an added advantage to the employee is that company health screening is not regarded as a taxable benefit, therefore everyone gains.</li>
            <li>Reduce expenses that coincide with long-term medical care.</li>
            <li>Keep insurance premiums the lowest possible with increased use of managed care prevention services</li>
            <li>Provide on-site educational seminars on prevention and wellness topics</li>
            <li>Increase productivity by reducing absenteeism due to health-related issues</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>Unique features that enhance our ability to partner with businesses:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>On-site/off-site screening</li>
            <li>Delivery of results directly after the test and the report can be sent via email</li>
            <li>Aggregate reporting – Giving you the average Biological Age versus the average Real Age of your employees.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>We provide a screening programme throughout the North West for both large and small worksite locations. Whether you decide to offer a corporate wellness program to your employees or promote our services to your clients, you are choosing an excellent
            way to increase your organisation’s profile, goodwill, and the prevention of increasing healthcare costs.</p>
