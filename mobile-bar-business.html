                    <p>Welcome to our Hire Bar business opportunity. We specialise in the full set-up of your chosen product into a fully operational business, including marketing to get your new business off to the best start possible! We believe help and
                        support is a key factor in any new business and we are proud to supply this for as long as you need it, FREE of charge!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Work for yourself, not by yourself”</strong></p>
                    <p>We do not charge any royalty or license fees, whatsoever. It is YOUR business outright. We simply set it up and guide you through the potential pitfalls, so you have the best chance to succeed and we make sure you don’t make the mistakes
                        that most people (who try to go it alone – due to a lack of experience), will make! We offer all the positives of a franchise without all the complications normally associated with them.</p>
                    <h4 class="text-center text-brand-primary"><strong>THE PRODUCT</strong></h4>
                    <p>Our Hire Bar business is a fantastic and very profitable business that can be run in your spare time, and simply put, can make you thousands of pounds’ profit in just one night. You can operate on a more management basis or, attend
                        the venues and work behind the bar if you wish.</p>
                    <p>From birthday parties to weddings or private functions, there is literally, never ending, repeat business, waiting for you to turn up and serve them great beer, drinks, snacks or, even food. Following our proven system and training
                        (no experience required) you’ll be able to operate your own outside bar/catering with ease!</p>
                    <p>Your main tasks are to organise the hiring out of the equipment to the customer for them to use themselves and supplying them with beer, drinks, etc. Or, supplying the equipment, drinks, food and staff to run the function yourself,
                        which is the most popular and most lucrative side of the business.</p>
                    <p>You do not need to actually work behind the bar itself if you do not wish to, but many people actually enjoy doing it. It will obviously save you money if you do, as it means one less member of staff to hire. We will arrange trade
                        prices for you at your local Cash ‘n’ Carry and you’ll be free to purchase your stock from anywhere you like! It’s your business, so no one will be telling you what to do, unlike a traditional pub, where you’re tied into the brewery
                        and their increased prices.</p>
                    <p>There are no overheads, as you can operate from home and you won’t need much space. A small spare room, garage or shed is sufficient.</p>
                    <p>We will supply you with everything you’ll need including full training. From coolers, to taps, keg beers and full trade access to everything you need to earn large profits. We even supply you with a full marketing campaign in your
                        chosen area, using our proven referral system and professional sales team, we will help generate you customers on a regular basis.</p>
                    <p>Our system is an excellent way to help get your new business off to the best start possible. You’ll meet some interesting people in this business, so it’s ideal for those who enjoy the outdoors and meeting people. Whether you’re retired,
                        semi-retired, or just starting on a new career, this is for you!</p>
