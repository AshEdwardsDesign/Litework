                    <p>Our Hire Bar business is a fantastic and very profitable business that can be run in your spare time, and simply put, can make you thousands of pounds’ profit in just one night. You can operate on a more management basis or, attend
                        the venues and work behind the bar if you wish.</p>
                    <p>From birthday parties to weddings or private functions, there is literally, never ending, repeat business, waiting for you to turn up and serve them great beer, drinks, snacks or, even food. Following our proven system and training
                        (no experience required) you’ll be able to operate your own outside bar/catering with ease!</p>
                    <p>Your main tasks are to organise the hiring out of the equipment to the customer for them to use themselves and supplying them with beer, drinks, etc. Or, supplying the equipment, drinks, food and staff to run the function yourself,
                        which is the most popular and most lucrative side of the business.</p>
                    <p>You do not need to actually work behind the bar itself if you do not wish to, but many people actually enjoy doing it. It will obviously save you money if you do, as it means one less member of staff to hire. We will arrange trade
                        prices for you at your local Cash ‘n’ Carry and you’ll be free to purchase your stock from anywhere you like! It’s your business, so no one will be telling you what to do, unlike a traditional pub, where you’re tied into the brewery
                        and their increased prices.</p>
                    <p>There are no overheads, as you can operate from home and you won’t need much space. A small spare room, garage or shed is sufficient.</p>
                    <p>We will supply you with everything you’ll need including full training. From coolers, to taps, keg beers and full trade access to everything you need to earn large profits. We even supply you with a full marketing campaign in your
                        chosen area, using our proven referral system and professional sales team, we will help generate you customers on a regular basis.</p>
                    <p>Our system is an excellent way to help get your new business off to the best start possible. You’ll meet some interesting people in this business, so it’s ideal for those who enjoy the outdoors and meeting people. Whether you’re retired,
                        semi-retired, or just starting on a new career, this is for you!</p>

                    <p>As you can see, the profit margins can be massive! You know your area, so you will know the going price for these drinks. You can work out your own profit margins as you will only increase the selling price.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                    <p>A typical party of 200 people, all buying only 5 drinks in one evening based on the above, gives you an average spend of £16.10 with a couple of bags of crisps included. Remember this is an average, as many people will drink much more,
                        whilst some will drink less.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>£16.10 x 200 people = £3,220.00</li>
                        <li>Your total profit on sales based on the above profit margins is £2,456.00</li>
                        <li>Minus staff wages from 3 people, or 2 if you work is £6.20 per hour x 5 hours = £93 or £62, if you work</li>
                        <li>Less consumables like C02 gas, straws, plastic glasses (If used), etc., £200</li>
                        <li>Total profit £2,163.00 assuming you did not work</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Not bad for 5 hours work or, maybe you just sat at home and let your staff manage it...?</p>
                    <p>1 venue a week = £8,652.00 per month, based on the above, which is easy, really, if you think about it once you're established. With our marketing, your Facebook friends and website all working for you, 1 venue per week is very possible!</p>

                    <p>Please note that due to licensing regulations, each individual licence holder can hold a maximum of 50 events annually.</p>
                    <p>That’s a potential of an amazing £103,824.00 per year!</p>
                    <p>Just 1 average size booking a month, can give you a full time income for little effort. Or, you may wish to work part-time or maybe a full time career, carrying out many bookings a month as you can, earning £££’s.</p>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need some working capital for your first venue, as you will have to provide, beer, drinks, etc., for that venue. The amount will depend on how big the venue is. Obviously, you will get this back the
                        same night in takings...</p>
                    <p>To give you an idea, a 200 person venue would cost you, about £900 to set up correctly. So, we recommend you have this amount as working capital, but remember you’ll have it back the same night plus, a few thousand more!</p>
