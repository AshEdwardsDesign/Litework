                    <p><strong>Testimonial:</strong></p>
                    <p>I am a Kinesiologist, have a busy clinic and also run the Academy for Systematic Kinesiology teaching many students each year to become health professionals. Time is always an issue with me (as it is with most of us) and I am continually
                        shown new products by people although this was different and I saw how helpful this device could be to my clients and my students.</p>
                    <p>I bought one straight away and have been using it ever since, my clients love being tested and enjoy reading the report to understand what is going on inside. We then discuss options to either keep healthy or move forward with lifestyle
                        changes/supplements and of course they can take the report to their doctor if concerned. All my clients book follow up sessions with me, even the people that showed younger than their actual age as they want to keep there! My clients
                        are also recommending friends to come and be tested so my business is growing as a result.</p>
                    <p>The service has also been great for my students, helping with their case studies, to earn an income whilst training plus help them see which supplements would be best for their clients circulatory health.</p>
                    <p>I would recommend anyone interested in health and helping people to go ahead and become an Anti-Ageing and Health consultant, the online training is very thorough and they are always there for you if you have any queries. The machine
                        has more than paid for itself within the first month and I am over the moon!</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>What will our system do for your clients?</strong></h4>
                    <p>It will provide them with detailed information on four areas of their health:</p>
                    <strong>Arterial Stiffness</strong>
                    <p>Assists your client to see how improving their arterial health will contribute to a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes</p>
                    <strong>Blood Pressure</strong>
                    <p>Helps your client to become aware of the importance of monitoring their blood pressure</p>
                    <strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong>
                    <p>Informs your client that being overweight can cause many health problems</p>
                    <strong>Biological Age</strong>
                    <p>Provides a marker to help clients see how the decisions and changes they make affect their state of health</p>
                    <h4><strong>What is a Class II Medical Device?</strong></h4>
                    <p>The device must have more than the simple general controls to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>It must comply with ‘special controls’: Special labelling requirements and mandatory performance standards recognised in Europe and internationally.</p>
                    <p>All devices require precise calibration and are extremely accurate.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Why is the condition of your clients’ arteries so important?</strong></h4>
                    <p>British Heart Foundation statistics state that 1 in 3 of us will have either a heart attack or stroke. In the majority of cases the main cause is narrow arteries.</p>

                    <p><em>"The test is a very simple one to administer and is completely safe and fits naturally within this range. The patient would then be given the appropriate information generated by the report along with other general health and lifestyle
        advice."</em>
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Dr Khalid Barakat MA (Oxon), MBBS (Lon), FRCP (UK)</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Consultant Cardiologist</strong></p>
                    <p><em>"More and more companies understand the importance of maintaining the well-being and health of their employees. Many offer annual health screening programmes and it would seem to us that the arterial stiffness testing would be a huge
        benefit to this type of programme, given that it is simple, relatively inexpensive and, a more safe and precise way of assessing vascular stiffness and vascular risk in the work environment."</em></p>

                    <h4><strong>How does our system work?</strong></h4>
                    <p>First we use equipment to test the condition of a person’s arteries, along with their blood pressure.</p>
                    <p>Our system then generates a comprehensive, easy to understand, seven page health report.</p>
                    <h4><strong>How does the equipment measure Arterial Stiffness?</strong></h4>
                    <p>The device measures the size of the ‘Pulse Wave’</p>
                    <p>The softness of the artery and the volume of blood delivered determines the size of the pulse wave</p>
                    <p>The smaller the pulse wave, the stiffer the artery</p>
                    <h4><strong>Blood Pressure</strong></h4>
                    <p>The monitoring equipment will accurately determine both Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure.</p>
                    <p><strong>High blood pressure can cause:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cardiovascular disease such as angina (chest pain caused by reduced blood flow), stroke, heart attack, heart failure and irregular heart beat</li>
                        <li>Kidney damage</li>
                        <li>Damaged sight</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>Body Mass Index (BMI)</strong></h4>
                    <p>Our system will help track your clients’ weight-to-height ratio (BMI).</p>
                    <p><strong>Being overweight can cause a range of health problems:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            High blood pressure
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            Diabetes
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gout (joint pain caused by excess uric acid)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sleep apnoea (interrupted breathing during sleep)

                        <li>
                            Osteoarthritis (wearing away of the joints)

                    </ul>
                    <h4><strong>Biological Age</strong></h4>
                    <p>Our advanced Class II medical equipment, together with our unique software can determine and track your clients’ biological age using a range of indicators, including arterial health, blood pressure and BMI.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is the definition of Biological Age?</strong></p>
                    <p>The active rate at which the body is ageing It is a true measurement of a person’s current health, life expectancy, and future quality of life.</p>
                    <p>This is different to a person’s chronological age, which is how many years they have been alive.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Monitoring your Clients’ progress</strong></h4>
                    <p>Your clients are likely to want repeat testing to enable them to monitor their progress and ascertain their ongoing requirements for natural foods and medical advice.</p>
                    <p>Each time your client has a repeat test, their results are added to a database and the charts within the report will track your client’s progress or regression over months and years.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Repeat Tests and Supplement Sales</strong></h4>
                    <p>The Health Report contains a guide as to when your client should return for a repeat test.</p>
                    <p><strong>To use our system, all you need is:</strong></p>
                    <p>A Laptop & Mobile Internet Access</p>
                    <p>(which we provide as part of the package)</p>
                    <h4><strong>Quick & Easy</strong></h4>
                    <p><strong>The procedure is quick and easy:</strong></p>
                    <p>Taking your clients’ readings should take less than five minutes.</p>
                    <p>Discussing the health report with your client should take about 20 minutes.</p>
                    <p>We recommend allocating approximately 15 to 20 minutes with your client.</p>
