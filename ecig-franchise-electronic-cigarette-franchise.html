                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Whether people want to quit smoking or want a way of smoking in public, these Electronic Cigarettes have a massive potential customer base”</strong></p>

                    <p>These cigarettes are a smokers dream for several reasons:</p>

                    <ul>
<li>Contains no tar or other carcinogenic substances</li>
<li>Not harmful to people and the environment</li>
<li>Does not produce second-hand smoke</li>
<li>Can be smoked in public places</li>
<li>Your customers can save up to 80% per year on smoking costs</li>
<li>No ignition so no fire hazards!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“A perfect solution to the public’s smoking problems”</strong></p>
                    <p>Electronic Cigarettes cost half the price of a pack of cigarettes at only £5 each (to your customer). These Electronic Cigarettes last for up to 250 puffs, which calculates to approximately 20 normal cigarettes. Various nicotine strengths and a menthol option are available to suit the individual. They light up and have a vapour just like the real thing!</p>

                    <p>This product has been tried and tested in the market place over several years with excellent results. Selling fantastically in Asia and the USA and now introduced here in the UK & Ireland by us.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Our cigarettes are excellent value, convenient to use and manufactured to a high standard”</strong></p>
                    <p>With millions of people trying to quit and smoking banned from all public places, Electronic Cigarettes have become a very popular replacement. They are proven to help people stop smoking or simply allow them to continue to smoke in public places.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“Our Electronic Cigarettes are a disposable, life-like and cheaper alternative to the real thing”</strong></p>
                    <p>We have introduced this unique product to make it a convenient way for people to purchase the product in public places that are likely to attract those who want an Electronic Cigarette. This way the product is in the correct venues and more likely to attract increased sales.</p>
                    <p>Britain has a drinking culture and millions of people go to the pub each week and with the smoking ban in place, pubs are the perfect location to sell these Electronic Cigarettes.</p>
                    <p>With our help and expert staff, we can have your business up and running in weeks, selling potentially dozens of Electronic Cigarettes per day!</p>
                    <p>What is a venue and how does it work?</p>
                    <p>Dependant on your chosen package, we will identify and advertise your product towards many potential venues throughout your chosen area. Typically, in order to maximise your chances of acquiring lucrative, high-footfall sites; a commission of 20% will be offered. We will of course discuss this with you beforehand.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“There is no selling involved from yourself”</strong></p>
                    <p>All that is required of yourself is taking the Electronic Cigarettes to your venues and keeping them stocked up regularly. You can easily keep track of your profit from the stock you have supplied. We will provide you with a sale or return form that the venues sign to acknowledge receipt of your stock, this form is designed to protect you and your investment.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“£5 for this type of Electronic Cigarette is the best price on the market”</strong></p>
                    <p>The venue will have your phone number in the event they run out of stock. However you should try and keep them well stocked at all times. Given prime positioning, the products sell themselves, especially at these prices. Due to the fact that our Electronic Cigarettes are disposable, you can benefit greatly from repeat sales.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“We guarantee all venues provided. If one under-performs, we will replace it”</strong></p>
                    <p>We will help you get your business off to the best start possible, but you can expand your business by selling the product at many other venues that you acquire yourself; festivals, car boot sales, etc! Just like with any business, the more work you put in, the more profit you gain!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>“If you need more venues, simply give us a call”</strong></p>
                    <p>We can help you get more venues to expand your business at any time so you wish to purchase an additional marketing package. Alternatively, you can acquire your own venues if you are confident and skilled enough to do so. There are many ways to expand your business or, you can just sit back and collect your revenue from the day we set-up your business.</p>
