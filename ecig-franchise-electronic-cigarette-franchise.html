                    <p>This product has been tried and tested in the market place with excellent results. Selling fantastically in Asia and the USA and now introduced here in the UK & Ireland by us.</p>
                    <p>Now we all know you can buy the e-cigarettes as a pack, with cartridges and a charger for around the £40 mark. But, you will lose the electronic cigarette at some point and have to spend another £40; and you have to replace the cartridges,
                        so you'll spend even more money!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Ours are better value for money, convenient and high quality"</strong></p>
                    <p>If the customer loses one of our disposable e-cigarettes, it's not going to cost them £40 to replace it, just £3.95 at point of sale or any other venues you have our product in.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"The customer's not too upset, but it's repeat business for you"</strong></p>
                    <p>With millions of people now trying to quit smoking and all public places banned from smoking, e-cigarettes have become a very popular replacement to help people stop smoking or allow them to continue to smoke in public places.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"Disposable, cheaper and just like the real thing"</strong></p>
                    <p>This is why we have introduced this unique product to make it a convenient way for people to purchase the product in public places that are likely to attract people who want this type of product. This way the product is in the correct
                        venue most likely to attract the most sales.</p>
                    <p>We have a drinking culture and millions of people each week go to the pub, and with the smoking ban in place it is a perfect situation to sell this product.</p>
                    <p>With our help and expert staff, we can have your business up and running in weeks, selling potentially dozens of e-cigarettes per day!</p>
                    <h4 class="text-brand-primary"><strong>What is a venue and how does it work?</strong></h4>
                    <p>We will locate and provide you with all the venues/retail outlets for you in your chosen area; many of these are smoking related places that have all agreed to sell the product to the end user for a commission of 20%.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"There is no selling involved"</strong></p>
                    <p>All you have to do is take your product to your venues and keep them stocked up! You can easily keep account of your money from the stock you supply. We have a small contract which the venue signs for your stock.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"£3.95 for this type of E-cigarette is the best price on the market"</strong></p>
                    <p>The venue (outlet) will have your phone number, just in-case they run out, but keep them well stocked up, so you're not inconvenienced too much! With prime positioning, the products sell themselves, especially at these prices and the
                        repeat business is far greater than our competitors, as ours are disposable!</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"We guarantee all venues, if one under performs, we will replace it"</strong></p>
                    <h4 class="text-brand-primary"><strong>Expand your business!</strong></h4>
                    <p>We will help you get your business off to the best start possible, but you can expand your business by selling the product at many other venues; festivals, car boot sales, etc! Let other people work for you for a commission.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"If you need more venues, simply give us a call"</strong></p>
                    <p>We can help you get more venues to expand your business at any time. Or, if you're up to it, you can get your own venues! Get other people to get venues for you. There are many ways to expand your business, or, you can just sit back
                        and collect your takings from the day we set-up your business.</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><strong>"It's up to you, simply collect in your spare time or expand with our unique product"</strong></p>

                    <p>Based on selling an average of 4x electronic cigarettes per day, per venue, here are some potential figures based on our most popular seller of a 10 venue package.</p>

                        <li>The products cost you £1.80+VAT</li>

                    <p>*Electronic cigarettes sold are across 10 x venues, over a 4 week period. We have kept the sales each week the same to give you an average of 4 sales per venue, per day. This will vary from day to day, some days you will sell more
                        than others.</p>
