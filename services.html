                        <h2>Cryolypolisis</h2>

                        <h3>The Science in more detail Definition of cavitation:</h3>

                        <p>Bubbles of liquid form and grow inside the fat, and inside these bubbles other micro bubbles full of gas are created which then expand, i.e. a gaseous cavity forms inside the liquid bubble.</p>
                        <p>The pressure exerted on the newly expanded bubbles compresses them, increasing the temperature of the gas contained inside the bubble until it collapses in on itself, imploding and releasing energy on the inside of the fatty material
                            and adipocytes, fluidising it and allowing them to escape.</p>

                        <h2>Stages of cavitation:</h2>

                        <h3>Physiological effects of ultrasound Thermal</h3>
                        <p>Lipolysis procedures attempt to “dissolve” fat cells by nonsurgical means. A number of methods have been attempted, including the use of laser , ultrasound and rf current. Popsicle panniculitis is a dermatologic condition that
                            shows that exposure to low temperatures can selectively damage subcutaneous fat while leaving the skin intact. Based on the premise that fat cells are more easily damaged by cooling than the skin is.</p>
                        <p>Cryolypolisis was developed to apply low temperatures to tissue via thermal condition. In order to avoid frostbite a specific temperature level and exposure is determined. When exposed to extreme cold, the body’s usual response
                            is to restrict circulation to keep the core of the body at the correct temperature. Only fat cells are frozen. Your healthy skin cells remain well and healthy. No needles no scars no pain ! Once crystallized the fat cells die
                            and are naturally eliminated from your body. This can take a few months. Where as, Cavitation treatments achieve results quicker.</p>

                        <h3>Formation of the fat nodules</h3>

                        <p>An excess of fat cells compresses the blood vessel. The pressure collapses the blood vessel. Fibre is replaced by dead cells and fatty residues.</p>
                        <p>Changes occur on the surface, better known as "orange peel syndrome". Using Ultrasound waves we will painlessly disrupt the walls of cells containing fat found below the skin. Please note that other tissues such as internal organs,
                            blood vessels and nerves are unharmed.</p>
                        <p>Disrupting the fat cells below the skin creates a bubbling affect i.e. just like water bubbling in a pan. As the cells knock against each other they generate heat and this causes the cell to pop allowing the now liquid fat to be
                            flushed out via the bloodstream to the liver. The liver processes the fat just as if you have eaten a</p>
                        <p>fatty/heavy meal, except that in this case all that fat came from yourself - your stomach, hips, thighs, or whichever part of your body you had chosen to be sculpted into a new shape.</p>
